{"body_length":4438,"time":"2015-11-12 13:13:09","reply_desired":"no","is_mailing_list":"no","subject":"Important Insurance Reminder (November 2015)","is_forward":"no","cc_num":0,"body":"If you have questions after reading this email, please email ihi@umich.edu.\n\n=============================\n\nThis is a reminder about the University's insurance requirement and procedures. Please read this message carefully to make sure that you understand these procedures.\n\n------------------------------\n\nINSURANCE REQUIREMENT: As you know, all F-1 students and any accompanying F-2 dependents must have insurance that meets U-M standards from the start date through the end date of their I-20 form, or the end date of their F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT), whichever is later.\n\nIMPORTANT REMINDER: This is a reminder that your enrollment in the University of Michigan's International Student\/Scholar Health Insurance Plan will be adjusted as necessary to ensure that you are covered by insurance throughout your F-1 stay, including any post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT).\n\nFOR EXAMPLE:\n\n\t  IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY COVERED BY THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENT\/SCHOLAR HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN and extend your I-20 form, your insurance will also be extended to the new I-20 end date.  You will be billed for the plan through your student account.\n\n\t  IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY COVERED BY ONE OF THE U-M BENEFITS OFFICE ADMINISTERED PLANS (such as GradCare)and your coverage by the Benefits Office plan ends before the end date of your I-20 form or your OPT end date (whichever is later), you will be automatically enrolled in the International Student\/Scholar Health Insurance Plan. You will be billed for the plan through your student account.\n\n\t  IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE AN \"INSURANCE WAIVER\" because you have private insurance (or insurance provided by your sponsor) that meets U-M standards and your waiver ends before your I-20 or OPT end date, you will be notified via email when your insurance waiver is about to expire.  You must then contact the International Center's insurance office to request an extension of your waiver. If you do not do so, or if your waiver extension is not approved, you will be automatically enrolled in the International Student\/Scholar Health Insurance Plan through the end date of your I-20 form or through your OPT end date. You will be billed for the plan through your student account.\n\nPLEASE REMEMBER THAT CHARGES FOR THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENT\/SCHOLAR INSURANCE PLAN CANNOT BE PRO-RATED. If you have the insurance for any part of a calendar month, you will be charged for the entire month.\n\nDEPARTURE FORMS:\n\nIf you leave the University PERMANENTLY before the end date of your I-20, or leave the United States because you have decided not to complete your post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT), it is very important to fill out and submit the online departure form.  A link to the form is at: http:\/\/internationalcenter.umich.edu\/immig\/forms\/#fstud\n\nIf you do not submit a departure form, the International Center will not know that you have ended your F-1 stay and your SEVIS record will not be correctly updated.\n\nAlso, if you do not submit a departure form, your enrollment in the University of Michigan's International Student\/Scholar Health Insurance Plan will continue to be adjusted as necessary to ensure that you are covered by insurance through the end date on your I-20 or the end date of your OPT (whichever is later.)\n\nFor example, if you were covered by a U-M benefits plan (such as GradCare) and that coverage ended when you left, you will be automatically re-enrolled in (and billed for) the international insurance plan through the end date of your I-20 or OPT.\n\nInsurance charges will not be reversed if you were billed because you did not fill out a departure form or if the form is not submitted before or immediately after your departure.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE FOR STUDENTS PLANNING TO DO POST-COMPLETION OPTIONAL PRACTICAL TRAINING:\n\nOnce you start OPT, you may be covered by insurance offered by your OPT employer. In that case, you should request an \"OPT insurance waiver\" by following the procedures at: http:\/\/internationalcenter.umich.edu\/healthins\/forms\/OPTwaiverform.pdf\n\nPlease be sure to submit this form as soon as the insurance from your OPT employer begins to avoid having to pay for the international plan longer than necessary.\n\n\nUniversity of Michigan International Center\n1500 Student Activities Building\n515 E.

My apologies for any confusion that may have created.\n\nThe corresponding assignment has also been created. Unlike homework two, there is just one assignment created for homework three, and it is indicated as an online submission. In other words, we did not create a separate assignment for the \"on paper\" submission, but of course you still need to submit your written work by the deadline. I also went back and deleted the \"on paper\" submission for homework two, so you will only see one assignment per homework from now on.\n\nI think we've about got it figured out, so hopefully future postings will go more smoothly.\n\nClay\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nhttps:\/\/umich.instructure.com\/courses\/5320\/announcements\/18684\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ________________________________________\n\n          You received this email because you are participating in one or more classes using Canvas.

This Scholarship targets at outstanding students, chosen on the basis of exceptional intellect, character, leadership, and commitment to service, to study at the University of Oxford.  Past Rhodes scholars include, Mr Bill Clinton (42nd US President); Mr Patrick Pichette (Senior VP and CFO, Google Inc.), Mr Ivan A. Getting (co-inventor of GPS technology), etc.\n\nThis year, we have the honor to have the new warden of Rhode Hall, Oxford University, Mr Conn, to give a talk.\n\nMr Conn will address the history of the Rhodes Scholarships, the organisation's association with Hong Kong and China, and the opportunity for Hong Kong graduates to study at Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship.  He will discuss the impact the Scholarships have had in identifying and developing talented leaders in the spheres of business, science & medicine, government, academia, and other areas.  In addition, Mr Conn will review the selection criteria for the Scholarships, which include intellectual achievement, personal character, demonstrated skill development, and the instinct to lead.\n\nThis talk will be conducted in English.

A traditional staple of Asian cuisine, it is a stable emulsion of oil, water, and protein. It is produced by soaking dry soybeans and grinding them with water. Soy milk can be made at home with traditional kitchen tools or with a soy milk machine.\n\n\nSoy milk has about the same amount of protein as cow's milk, though the amino acid profile differs. Natural soy milk contains little digestible calcium as it is bound to the bean's pulp, which is indigestible by humans. To counter this, many manufacturers enrich their products with calcium carbonate available to human digestion. Unlike cow's milk, it has little saturated fat and no cholesterol. Soy milk is also found in many vegan and vegetarian food products and can be used as a replacement for cow's milk in many recipes.\n\nWe are pleased to have invited Soy Milk Nutrition Expert from Vitasoy to explain the making of soymilk. They will introduce the nutrition benefits of its different products (basic, organic, fortified). How the key sensory attributes (beaniness, cereal, creaminess, aftertaste, sweetness, thickness) that defines soymilk. There will also be culinary demonstration with your tasting opportunities.

After this \ndate, some Mesh functions, such as remote desktop and peer to peer \nsync, will no longer be available and any data on the Mesh cloud, \ncalled Mesh synced storage or SkyDrive synced storage, will be \nremoved. The folders you synced with Mesh will stop syncing, and you \nwill not be able to connect to your PCs remotely using Mesh. \n\nWe encourage you to [try out the new SkyDrive] to see how it can meet \nyour needs.\nhttp:\/\/email.microsoft.com\/Key-11116802.D.CPBJ.D.Jy.Fx831Z\n\nDuring the transition period, we suggest that, in addition to using \nMesh, you sync your Mesh files using SkyDrive. This way, you can try \nout SkyDrive without changing your existing Mesh setup. For tips on \ntransitioning to SkyDrive, see [SkyDrive for Mesh users] on the \nWindows website.\nhttp:\/\/email.microsoft.com\/Key-11116802.D.CPBJ.F.Jy.Fx8xSD\n\nIf you have questions, you can post them in the [SkyDrive forums]. \nhttp:\/\/email.microsoft.com\/Key-11116802.D.CPBJ.G.Jy.Fx9NMr\n\nMesh customers have been influential and your feedback has helped \nshape our strategy for Mesh and SkyDrive. We would not be here \nwithout your support and hope you continue to give us feedback as \nyou use SkyDrive.  \n \nSincerely, \nThe Windows Live Mesh and SkyDrive teams \n \nFrequently Asked Questions  \n \nWhy is this happening?  \nOver the years, customers have asked us to bring many of the \nbenefits of SkyDrive - including mobile access and online \ncollaboration - to Windows Live Mesh. We've also received requests \nfor some of the features of Mesh - such as syncing and remote \naccess - to SkyDrive. Bringing together key features of both products \ninto SkyDrive allows us to maintain a single product and deliver all \nof these benefits to customers. Moving forward, a single product also \nallows us to quickly deliver more new features to everyone. \n \nWhat features are available on SkyDrive?  \nSync your entire SkyDrive or only select folders with your computer. \nWith the SkyDrive desktop app for Windows or Mac, your files on \nSkyDrive are available online or offline - and update automatically \nacross your computers. \nMore storage - Every SkyDrive customer automatically receives 7 GB of \nfree SkyDrive storage, two more than Mesh. If you need more, you can \npurchase up to an additional 100 GB to meet your needs. Just sign in \nto SkyDrive.com and click Manage storage in the lower left corner. \nGreat views - SkyDrive has several features Mesh didn't include. \nFor example, with SkyDrive you can sort files, change file views, \nview photo slide shows, and stream video. \n \n \nWhat can I expect between now and the date when Windows Live Mesh \nis retired?  \nFor now, Mesh will continue to work the same as always. We'll send \nyou reminder emails as the retirement date for Mesh gets closer.  \n \nWhere can I learn more?  \nFor more information, see [SkyDrive for Mesh users].\nhttp:\/\/email.microsoft.com\/Key-11116802.D.CPBJ.H.Jy.Fx91Hf\n\nYou'll find details about how to make the switch to SkyDrive, as well \nas updates about the changes to Mesh.  \n \nCan I use SkyDrive to connect to a PC remotely and run apps on it?  \nNo, with SkyDrive you can fetch files on a remote PC, but you can't \nconnect to it remotely to work as if you were sitting in front of it. \nIf you want to connect to a work PC, try Remote Desktop Connection \nin Windows. With Remote Desktop Connection, you can connect to PCs \nthat are running these editions of Windows: \nWindows 8 Pro, Windows 8 Enterprise \nWindows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 7 Ultimate \nWindows Vista Business, Windows Vista Ultimate, \nWindows Vista Enterprise, Windows XP Professional \n \n \nTo remotely connect to a Mac or other Windows operating systems not \nlisted above, we recommend creating a [LogMeIn] account.\nhttp:\/\/email.microsoft.com\/Key-11116802.D.CPBJ.J.Jy.Fx9twV\n\n[LogMeIn Pro] gives you fast, easy remote computer access from your \ndevices over the web in HD.\nhttp:\/\/email.microsoft.com\/Key-11116802.D.CPBJ.K.Jy.FxbKrK\n\nTransfer files, print remotely, or keep machines up to date from any \ncomputer or your mobile device.  \n\n**********************************************************************\n\n[Microsoft]\nhttp:\/\/email.microsoft.com\/Key-11116802.D.CPBJ.L.Jy.FxbYkx\n\nMicrosoft respects your privacy. \nTo learn more, please read our [Privacy Statement].\nhttp:\/\/email.microsoft.com\/Key-11116802.D.CPBJ.M.Jy.Fxbbfl\n\nMicrosoft Corporation\nOne Microsoft Way\nRedmond, WA 98052\n\n\n**********************************************************************\n\n.\n\n","is_to":"no","is_cc":"no","is_bcc":"yes","is_reply":"no","got_reply":"no"}

Welcome to Week 3 of the course, which will cover network virtualization in more detail.  Last week, you gained some initial exposure to Mininet, with a basic setup.  Mininet is just one example of a technology that uses network virtualization, which allows the creation of multiple logical networks on top of a single, shared physical infrastructure.  There are other instances of virtualization across both academia and industry; this week, we'll look at examples from both.  You'll learn what network virtualization is, how it is implemented, and how to use it to perform various tasks.\n\n\n\nWe have been monitoring the forums and have several suggestions and comments:\n\n\n\n\n\n Mininet Image.  There was some confusion about which VM image people should be using for the course.  The correct image is the Pyretic 0.2.0 image that is hosted on the Coursera site.[https:\/\/d19vezwu8eufl6.cloudfront.net\/sdn\/srcs\/pyretic_0.2.0.ova].  We apologize for the confusion that may have resulted in you using the image from the OpenFlow tutorial.  We made the Mininet setup video before finalizing the Pyretic VM.  If you have already started using the VM from the OpenFlow tutorial, don't worry; you'll be fine until the fifth week of the course, when you'll either need to download the \"official\" VM or install Pyretic into your VM.   Some people who have 32-bit machines could not load the \"official\" VM image; a student in the forum; here is a 32-bit image[https:\/\/class.coursera.org\/sdn-001\/forum\/thread?thread_id=239&amp;utm_classid=970200&amp;utm_nottype=class.generic&amp;utm_notid=506&amp;utm_linknum=2], courtesy of Wojciech Mazur, which should work for those of you who are on 32-bit machines.  We are working on an official release for 32-bit machines, which will also include Pyretic, and we will post a link for that VM once it is available.  Thanks for your patience!\n\nProgramming Assignment. There is a programming assignment this week that asks you to use the Mininet Python API to create a simple topology.  Read the assignment early in the week and post questions if you are unsure about anything.  The assignment is not difficult if you watch the lectures; it is no more than 20 lines of Python and should be straightforward if you understand the concepts.  If you get stuck, please post to the forums and we will provide hints.  We are here to help!\n\nForum Discussions. The forum discussions have been very interesting; we have been following them as much as we can, and we are tailoring later parts of the course based on discussions and feedback there.

The freely accessible website is described as \"the most comprehensive visualization of U.S. public data,\" and it uses open source software code so developers can build custom applications by adding other data. Data USA project director and Media Lab professor Cesar A. Hidalgo says the site aims to \"transform data into stories\" typically rendered as graphics, charts, and written summaries. In one example, the action of typing \"New York\" into the search box summons a drop-down menu of choices such as the city, the metropolitan area, and the state. When a user selects an option, the page displays related images and basic statistics, while on a lower level are six icons for related subject categories. The icons link to data stories enhanced with graphics. Deloitte contributed funding and expertise to the project, and Deloitte's Patricia Buckley says the purpose of Data USA is to \"organize and visualize data in a way that a lot of people think about it.\" Northwestern University professor Kris Hammond predicts the type of data analysis Data USA uses, in which the site makes assumptions about users and codes those assumptions within its software, will become more commonplace.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e125x056162&\n\n\nHow Facebook Is Helping the Blind 'See' Pictures Their Friends Share Online\nThe Washington Post (04\/05\/16) Andrea Peterson\n\nFacebook on Tuesday launched Automatic Alternative Text, a tool designed to enable sight-impaired users to \"see\" pictures posted by friends online.  For this feature to work, users must have Apple's built-in screen reader turned on and select an image in the text.  Facebook applies artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify basic features in the image and produce a new alt text that the screen reader will share with the user.  The feature will be initially rolled out for the English-language version of Facebook's main iOS, and it will only identify about 100 fundamental concepts because Facebook only wants to suggest an image contains objects its AI tech can reliably recognize, says the company's Jeffrey Wieland.  Automatic Alternative Text developer Matt King says more work must be done online to improve picture accessibility, noting AI and facial-recognition data could be used to inform blind users of who the people in a photo are, instead of only how many there are.  Facebook is among many tech firms and several universities in a working group founded to better prepare students to invent inclusive technology.  Other technologies in development follow a similar AI approach to images as Facebook, with Microsoft recently showcasing its SeeingAI app at a developers conference.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e126x056162&\n\n\nUsing Data Science to Solve Society's Problems\nBaseline (04\/05\/16) Samuel Greengard\n\nDeveloping data science solutions to address real-world societal challenges is the purpose of the Data Science Bowl, a 90-day contest launched by Booz Allen Hamilton and Kaggle in 2015.  \"What is compelling about the competition is that there are researchers from around the world working on a very real problem with very real benefits to society,\" says Booz Allen Hamilton principal Steven Mills.  \"Although the prize money is substantial, most people enter the competition because they are passionate about data science and making the world a better place.  Many of the participants are passionate about what they do, and they are eager to contribute to society.\"  This year's competition focused on heart disease diagnosis, which involved 1,392 algorithms submitted by 993 participants.  The winning software from hedge fund analysts Qi Liu and Tencia Lee can enable real-time heart disease diagnosis from a magnetic resonance imaging scan, a milestone that could speed up scanning, cut medical costs, and facilitate new research methods.  Last year's contest focused on rapidly assessing ocean health on a vast scale, and challenged entrants to examine a massive image archive.  The winning algorithm from Ghent University can automatically classify more than 100,000 underwater images of plankton.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e127x056162&\n\n\nIBM Introduces Cognitive Storage\neWeek (04\/04\/16) Darryl K. Taft\n\nIBM researchers have developed Cognitive Storage, a new approach to storage they say helps computers learn what they should remember and what they can forget.  The concept breaks down the difference between what the human brain would view as memories and what it would view as information.  The differentiation could be used to determine what is stored, where it is stored, and for how long, according to IBM.  The idea is based on a metric known as data value, which is analogous to determining the value of a piece of art.  To determine this value, IBM tracked the access patterns of data or the frequency with which it is used.  The researchers also added metadata tags to the data to help train the system, depending on the context in which the data is used.  The company's cognitive storage initiative could be available very soon.  \"With rising costs in energy and the explosion in big data, particularly from the Internet of Things, this is a critical challenge as it could lead to huge savings in storage capacity, which means less media costs and less energy consumption,\" IBM says in a blog post.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e132x056162&\n\n\nAt MIT, a Glimpse Into Our Techno Future\nComputerworld (04\/06\/16) Patrick Thibodeau\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab researcher David Rose discussed futuristic systems that employ Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to enable a hyper-connected world at Tuesday's \"Connected Things\" Enterprise Forum.  Among the concepts Rose cited were home-based aeroponic systems for growing vegetables, the incorporation of collapsible systems and movable walls into home and furniture design to support as-needed repurposing, mesh-networked residential systems, and connected-sharing services.  Rose and other participants also raised questions about what goals these developments are supposed to fulfill, and their societal implications.  \"There has to be a standard about how these [IoT] devices communicate,\" says Itamco owner Joel Neideig.  McKinsey Global Institute partner Michael Chui says about 60 percent of technology's value in the business-to-business sector cannot be realized without interoperability.  Meanwhile, Sypris Electronics president John Walsh says the lack of a \"perimeter\" for cyber-physical systems thwarts traditional security measures, and he stresses \"we want to get the carbon [humans] out of the loop.\"  MIT professor Sanjay Sarma predicts a few calamities stemming from breaches are likely unavoidable, because security improvements will not come quickly enough.  Consultant Rasmus Blom makes a case for IoT systems by arguing the instrumenting of systems brings us \"much closer to the real need of people and society.\"\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e129x056162&\n\n\nData-Mining Algorithm Reveals the Stormy Evolution of Mathematics Over 700 Years\nTechnology Review (04\/01\/16)\n\nUniversity of Namur researcher Floriana Gargiulo and colleagues are using network science to map the links between mathematicians of the last 700 years to understand how the discipline of mathematics has evolved and spread.  They analyzed the Mathematical Genealogy Project database listing each scientist's dates, geographical location, mentors, students, and discipline.  The analysis began by using a machine-learning algorithm to check and update the data against other sources of information, and then the researchers built a network in which each scientist was a node and connections existed when one was a mentor or student of another.  The team analyzed the resulting webs to detect in-network clusters, tipping points, and influential nodes.  Standard clustering algorithms determined math can be split into 84 family trees, and 65 percent of the scientists in the database are derived from only 24 of these trees.  The biggest tree originated in 1415 under the mentorship of a medical doctor in Italy, while countries' specific roles in producing mathematicians and how this has shifted over time was revealed.  Other notable trends included the tendency for science-poor nations to import mathematicians while those with a stronger math tradition are exporters.  Another key finding concerns the merger of math fields into new disciplines, such as statistics and probability's integration between 1930 and 1940.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e12ax056162&\n\n\nScientists Push Valleytronics One Step Closer to Reality\nBerkeley Lab News Center (04\/04\/16) Dan Krotz\n\nScientists have experimentally demonstrated the ability to electrically generate and control valley electrons in a two-dimensional semiconductor.  The team from the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) coupled a host ferromagnetic semiconductor with a monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC).  Electrical spin injection from the ferromagnetic semiconductor localized the charge carriers to one momentum valley in the TMDC monolayer.  Valleytronic devices have the potential to transform high-speed data communications and lower-power devices, but gaining electrical control over the population of valley electrons has proven challenging for researchers so far.  The Berkeley Lab breakthrough also is important because it involved TMDCs, which are considered to be more device-ready than other semiconductors that exhibit valleytronic properties.  The team's research could lead to a new type of electronics that utilize all three degrees of freedom--charge, spin, and valley--which together could encode an electron with eight values of information compared with two in today's electronics.  Future computer chips  based on the technology would enable faster and more energy-efficient computing devices.  \"This is the first demonstration of electrical excitation and control of valley electrons, which will accelerate the next generation of electronics and information technology,\" says Berkeley Lab's Xiang Zhang, who led the study.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e12bx056162&\n\n\nNew Algorithm by Engineering Professor Could Optimize Netflix Recommendations\nColumbia Spectator (04\/04\/16) Jerica Tan\n\nColumbia University professor Shipra Agrawal has proposed an algorithm that could improve content recommendation systems such as the one used by Netflix.  Agrawal's algorithm would base recommendations on what users watched in the past, but also on their unexplored preferences.  She says such an approach is especially important for platforms looking to improve long-term recommendations, although there is risk associated with exploring too much when users are already confident in their likes and dislikes.  Agrawal has developed an algorithm that can calculate the amount of exploration a user should face, along with the genres the user already has sufficiently explored.  She says the algorithm differs from others currently in use because it can account for factors such as the many complications that arise in real-life applications.  Factors can range from the changing preferences of a single user to the limits of a finite amount of content.  \"The algorithm automatically figures out which are the areas that you need to explore, which are the areas you are confident about,\" Agrawal says.  \"It will observe your response, and it will then tell whether the recommendation was good or not.  But it will also keep account of what kind of recommendations it doesn't have data for.\"\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e133x056162&\n\n\nTAU Uses 'Deep Learning' to Assist Overburdened Diagnosticians\nAmerican Friends of Tel Aviv University (04\/04\/16)\n\nTel Aviv University (TAU) researchers have developed a range of tools to facilitate the computer-assisted diagnosis of x-rays, computed tomographic (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The researchers say the new system will enable radiologists to attend to complex cases that require their full attention, without spending as much time on simpler cases.  \"Our goal is to use computer-assisted 'Deep Learning' technologies to differentiate between healthy and non-healthy patients, and to categorize all pathologies present in a single image through an efficient and robust framework that can be adapted to a real clinical setting,\" says TAU professor Hayit Greenspan.  The researchers want to use deep learning to develop diagnostic tools for the automated detection and labeling of pathologies in radiographic images.  They have already developed the deep-learning technology to support automated chest x-ray pathology identification, liver lesion detection, MRI lesion analysis, and other tasks.  \"Such systems can improve accuracy and efficiency in both basic and more advanced radiology departments around the world,\" Greenspan says.  The system is based on transfer learning, in which networks originally trained on regular images are used to categorize medical images.  Greenspan notes the features and parameters that represent millions of general images provide a good signature for the analysis of medical images as well.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e12dx056162&\n\n\nTo Beat Go Champion, Google's Program Needed a Human Army\nThe New York Times (04\/04\/16) George Johnson\n\nBehind the Google AlphaGo computer program's recent defeat of human Go champion Lee Se-dol were the many human brains that developed and executed the software.  In AlphaGo, deep neural networks were trained on a database of past Go maneuvers by human players, and the algorithm played itself over and over again to refine this knowledge and become more proficient at the game.  The combination of insensate learning with the Monte Carlo tree search method enabled the program to defeat Lee.  Despite this victory, experts say artificial intelligence has a long way to go before it can compete with human intelligence.  \"Humans can learn to recognize patterns on a Go board--and patterns related to faces and patterns in language--and even patterns of patterns,\" notes Portland State University researcher Melanie Mitchell.  \"This is what we do every second of every day.  But AlphaGo only recognizes patterns related to Go boards and has no ability to generalize beyond that--even to games similar to Go but with different rules.\"  Computer scientists are attempting to create programs capable of more efficient generalizing, but for now the human mind remains superior to neural nets in this capacity.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e12ex056162&\n\n\nThe Twittersphere Does Listen to the Voice of Reason--Sometimes\nUW Today (04\/04\/16) Jennifer Langston\n\nTweets from the official accounts of government agencies, emergency responders, media, or companies at the center of a fast-moving story can slow the spread of rumors and correct misinformation that has taken on a life of its own, according to researchers at the University of Washington.  The team from the Emerging Capacities of Mass Participation Laboratory in the Department of Human Centered-Design & Engineering and the Information School's DataLab documented the spread of two online rumors that initially spiked on Twitter--alleged police raids in a Muslim neighborhood during a hostage situation in Sydney, Australia, and the rumored hijacking of a WestJet flight to Mexico.  The vast majority of tweets both affirming and denying the two rumors were retweets of a small number of Twitter accounts, and were largely driven by \"breaking news\" accounts that offer the veneer of officialdom.  However, the \"breaking news\" accounts do not necessarily follow standard journalistic practices of confirming information.  The rumors were successfully quashed by denials from official accounts.  The team says the case studies offer crisis management lessons for organizations.  The researchers presented their findings at the ACM CSCW 2016 conference in March.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e12fx056162&\n\n\nGestures Improve Communication, Even With Robots\nScience Daily (04\/04\/2016)\n\nA new study by researchers in the U.K. found it is easier for people to understand robot avatars when they use \"iconic\" hand gestures together with speech.  Moreover, people are able to understand avatars using such multi-modal communication as well as they do other humans.  Scientists Paul Bremner and Ute Leonards used a Microsoft Kinect sensor to track the arm gestures of a human actor, and then an avatar used the recorded data to mimic the movements.  Bremner and Leonards filmed the human actor reading out a series of phrases while performing specific gestures, and then filmed the avatar using these recorded phrases and mimicking the gestures.  Experiment participants watched the video and tried to identify what the human and avatar were trying to communicate.  The researchers say getting a message across with an avatar is more important than ever.  They note avatars are used by millions of people worldwide, and now are employed to entertain, teach, sell products, and solve problems.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e130x056162&\n\n\nHardware, Software Tools Created to Debug Intermittently Powered Energy-Harvesting Devices\nPhys.org (04\/04\/16)\n\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and Disney Research have developed the Energy-interference-free Debugger (EDB), a system for finding computer bugs in small devices that scavenge energy from their environment and are subject to intermittent power failures.  The researchers built a hardware and software platform that can monitor and debug these intermittent systems without interfering with the device's energy state.  \"The use of energy-harvesting devices will only proliferate as increasing numbers of sensor networks are deployed and other devices such as solar-powered microsatellites are invented,\" and it is important these devices have reliable software, so there must be tools to help detect and correct bugs, according to Disney Research vice president Jessica Hodgins.  The researchers say the hardware-software debugging tool is the first to bring essential, familiar application development support to intermittent devices.  \"The key to our approach is that we provide flexible debugging support without interfering with the target device's power system,\" says CMU professor Brandon Lucia.  The EDB system can passively monitor an energy-harvesting device for its energy level, input\/output events, and program events, as well as manipulate the amount of energy stored on the device, enabling engineers to inject or remove power based on code execution.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2e131x056162&\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nUnsubscribe from ACM TechNews at http:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2b0ebx056162&\n\nChange your Email Address for TechNews (log into myACM) at http:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-edd5x2b058x056162&\n\n","is_to":"yes","is_cc":"no","is_bcc":"no","is_reply":"no","got_reply":"no"}

Some of them don't conceptually make sense as NULL (e.g.\u00a0an album with no username), but some of them seem possible (e.g. a user with no email).

We should reject it, but should we redirect the user to an error web page, or just do nothing? I guess displaying an error message on the current page is fine, but why do the other ways mess up the autograder?

At Georgia Tech, professor Ashok Goel tapped IBM technology to develop and deploy \"Jill Watson,\" software that helps students in his Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence class design programs to enable computers to meet certain challenges.  Students note \"Ms. Watson\" would engage with them in a conversational format to remind them of assignment due dates and post mid-week questions to encourage dialogues.  In 2015, Georgia Tech researchers started the AI's development by sifting through about 40,000 questions on a discussion forum and training the program to answer based on prior responses.  Ms. Watson was deployed in January and by late March started posting responses to questions live.  Goel says the program only answers a question if it has a minimum confidence rate of 97 percent, making its expertise far superior to that of the average online customer-service chatbot.  He predicts Ms. Watson will be capable of answering 40 percent of all students' questions within a year.  \nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2e324x056330&\n\n\nBuilding AI Is Hard--So Facebook Is Building AI That Builds AI\nWired (05\/06\/16) Cade Metz\n\nFacebook is building artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that can help build AI algorithms by automating much of the trial and error that goes into their testing.  \"We wanted to build a machine-learning assembly line that all engineers at Facebook could use,\" says Facebook engineer Hussein Mehanna, whose team built a tool known as Flow.  With Flow, engineers can build, test, and execute machine-learning algorithms on a huge scale, enabling the testing of a limitless stream of AI concepts across Facebook's data center network.  Mehanna says the company uses Flow to train and test approximately 300,000 machine-learning models every month.  He notes this has made it possible for Facebook to launch several new AI models onto its social network every week, whereas it used to deploy a new model onto the network about every 60 days.  Mehanna says Facebook intends eventually to make Flow open source so the rest of the world, including companies such as Twitter and Uber, can use it.  Another tool from his team, AutoML, runs atop Flow to automatically \"clean\" data needed to train algorithms so they are ready for testing without human intervention.  AutoML can apply the outcomes of tests on machine-learning models to train another model that can optimize the training of other models.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2e325x056330&\n\n\nDigital Media May Be Changing How You Think\nDartmouth College (05\/08\/16) Amy Olson\n\nDartmouth College researchers have found using digital platforms such as tablets and laptops for reading could make users more inclined to focus on concrete details instead of interpreting information more abstractly.  In order to examine the basic question of whether processing the same information on digital versus non-digital platforms would trigger a different baseline \"interpretive lens\" that would influence how users interpret information, the researchers attempted to hold as many factors as possible constant between the digital and non-digital platforms.  The study consisted of four tests and more than 300 participants, which evaluated how information processing is affected by each platform.  The researchers found reading comprehension and problem-solving success were affected by the type of platform used.  For abstract questions, participants using the non-digital platform scored higher on inference questions with 66 percent correct, compared to those using the digital platform, who had 48 percent correct.  For concrete questions, participants using the digital platform scored better with 73 percent correct, while those using the non-digital platform had 58 percent correct.  When presented with a table of information, 66 percent of participants using the non-digital platform reported the correct answer, compared to 43 percent of those using the digital platform.  The researchers will present their work this week at ACM CHI 2016 in San Jose, CA.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2e326x056330&\n\n\nDesign Tool Enables Novices to Create Bendable Input Devices for Computers\nPhys.org (05\/06\/16)\n\nResearchers at ETH Zurich and Disney have developed DefSense, software that enables non-experts to design and build flexible objects that can sense when they are being deformed and be used to control other electronic devices.  The research team will present the optimization-based algorithm this week at ACM CHI 2016 in San Jose, CA.  \"[Three-dimensional-printed] objects that can sense their own deformation will open the door to a range of exciting applications, such as personalized toys, custom game controllers, and electronic musical instruments,\" says Disney Research's Markus Gross.  The objects can sense when they are bent because they are made with piezoresistive materials.  The electrical resistivity of the wires changes when they are bent, enabling it to infer the amount of deformation based on changes in measured resistivity.  \"Determining how to route the sensors within the object and how to interpret their readings is a complex design problem in all but the most trivial cases,\" says Disney researcher Moritz Bacher.  The researchers developed a design process in which the user creates the shape of the object and specifies the deformations that need to be sensed.  An optimization algorithm then computes sensor layouts based on those example deformations and iteratively guides the designer in placing the wires within the object.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2e327x056330&\n\n\nThe Scientists Who Simulate the End of the World\nCo.Design (05\/06\/16) Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan\n\nThe U.S. National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) models how national infrastructure and human behavior would be affected by attacks or catastrophes ranging from cyber-sieges to global pandemics to severe weather.  The analytical discipline developed at NISAC, founded in 1999, is known as Complex Adaptive Systems of Systems (CASoS), which applies chaos theory and other concepts to real-world problems as they transpire.  CASoS uses modern computing resources to simulate not only billions of actors and systems, but also how those systems interact globally, as well as their adaptation patterns based on ecosystem-wide dynamic changes.  One application of CASoS by NISAC was a model of a global avian flu pandemic in 2005 to test a hypothesis that the best aversion strategy would be thinning the potential network of infectees.  NISAC reflects the importance to the federal government of predicting how adaptive systems will respond to and evolve from disruptions, and some issues involve simulating human behavior at times of crisis.  NISAC's modus operandi is to develop a program with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security outlining the topics it might study for that year to create a document other federal agencies can use in a crisis.  For example, the work of NISAC in the decades ahead could focus on developing predictive tools cities can use to model and adapt to extreme weather.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2e328x056330&\n\n\nAIs Are Starting to Learn Like Human Babies by Grasping and Poking Objects\nQuartz (05\/05\/16) Joon Ian Wong\n\nA project at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) could enable artificial intelligences (AIs) to learn in a more human way.  The CMU researchers note babies learn by poking and pushing, and say their goal is to use physical robotic interactions to teach an AI to recognize objects.  The team programmed a robotic arm to grasp, push, poke, and perceive an object from multiple angles, and they enabled it to interact with 100 objects and collected 130,000 data points.  The researchers fed the data into a convolutional neural network to train it to learn a visual representation of each of the 100 objects.  The neural network was able to more accurately classify images of the objects on the ImageNet research database with the touch data than without it.  \"The overall idea of robots learning from continuous interaction is a very powerful one,\" says University of Washington professor Sergey Levine.  \"Robots collect their own data, and in principle they can collect as much of it as they need, so learning from continuous active interaction has the potential to enable tremendous progress in machine perception, autonomous decision-making, and robotics.\"\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2e329x056330&\n\n\nNot Lost in Translation: Researchers 'Teach' Computers to Translate Accurately\nIDG News Service (05\/06\/16) Agam Shah\n\nScientists are seeking to improve the capabilities of online translation programs by embedding new artificial intelligence methods that could help accurately build complete sentences.  University of Liverpool researchers have developed algorithms that translate words and languages while incorporating a human-like touch that could potentially boost accuracy.  The algorithms will enable a computer to translate a word from an unknown language, and then infuse context within so it can build a proper sentence by adding words around it.  The algorithms are designed to look up the meaning of words via services such as WordNet, and use a scoring mechanism to gauge the correlation of words when constructing a sentence.  Liverpool researcher Danushka Bollegala says the programs' ability to help computers understand words is similar to \"teaching languages to computers.\"  He says the technology is one step toward creating a precise universal translator.  It is currently possible to translate words with high rates of accuracy via Google Translate, but this technique can still yield poor sentence structures and frequently misconstrued meanings.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2e32ax056330&\n\n\nChameleon: Why Computer Scientists Need a Cloud of Their Own\nHPC Wire (05\/05\/16) Tiffany Trader\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation-funded Chameleon cloud testbed in less than a year of operation has contributed to innovative research in high-performance computing (HPC) containerization, exascale operating systems, and cybersecurity.  Chameleon principal investigator Kate Keahey, a Computation Institute fellow at the University of Chicago, describes the tool as \"a scientific instrument for computer science where computer scientists can prove or disprove hypotheses.\"  Co-principal investigator Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin, says Chameleon can meet the oft-denied request from the software or computer science research community to make fundamental changes to the way the machine operates.  With Chameleon, users can configure and test distinct cloud architectures on various problems, such as machine learning and adaptive operating systems, climate modeling, and flood prediction.  Keahey says support for research at multiple scales was a key design element of the instrument.  One project using Chameleon involves comparing performance between containerization and virtualization as they apply to HPC applications.  Keahey says it is \"a good example of a project that really needs access to scale.\"  Another major Chameleon user is the Argo Project, an initiative for designing and prototyping an exascale operating system and runtime.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2e32bx056330&\n\n\nNYU Tandon Doctoral Student's Cochlear Implant Technology Banishes Ambient Babble\nNYU Tandon School of Engineering (05\/03\/2016)\n\nPeople with cochlear implants and hearing aids often have difficulty understanding what someone is saying due to \"babble,\" or the mix of speech and other ambient sounds.  New York University (NYU) researchers have devised an algorithmic approach that filters the talker's voice from a background of noise.  NYU doctoral student Roozbeh Soleymani developed a technology called Speech Enhancement using Decomposition Approach (SEDA) with professors Ivan Selesnick and David Landsberger in the NYU Tandon Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the NYU Langone Department of Otolaryngology, respectively.  SEDA works by decomposing a speech signal into waveforms that differ not just in frequency but also in how many oscillations each wave contains.  \"Some waveforms in the SEDA process comprise many oscillations while other comprise just one,\" says Selesnick, whose U.S. National Science Foundation-funded research in 2010 helped trigger Soleymani's work.  \"Waveforms with few oscillations are less sensitive to babble, and SEDA is based on this underlying principle,\" Soleymani says.  Selesnick notes this powerful signal-analysis method is practical only now because of the computational power available in today's electronic devices.  The potential uses for SEDA could encompass cellphones as well, according to Landsberger.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2e32cx056330&\n\n\nA New Mobile Phone App for Grassroots Mapping\nUniversity of Exeter (05\/04\/16)\n\nUniversity of Exeter researchers have developed a mobile phone application that uses geographic data to map landscapes and help humanitarian rescue workers in disaster-struck regions.  The app enables a stranded smartphone to be converted into a self-contained remote sensing device.  It uses conventional sensors already in existing smartphones to generate ready-to-use spatial data when the device is suspended from lightweight aerial platforms such as drones or kites.  The app gathers the data and enables the smartphone to operate autonomously, so once airborne it can capture images.  In addition, the app can be \"live-coded,\" which means it is not fixed in its functionality, so the user can program it to behave as desired and capture images according to specific criteria.  \"We found that the best results were obtained when the phone was attached to a stable single-line kite or to a gliding drone so as to limit the vibrations, but there will undoubtedly be a wide range of ways of capturing high-quality data using this app and we are really keen to learn about the ways it is being used,\" says FoAM Kernow director Dave Griffiths, who collaborated on the research.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2e32dx056330&\n\n\nNew Wi-Fi-based Network Keeps Facebook Servers at Bay\nThe Stack (UK) (05\/04\/16) John Bensalhia\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles researchers have developed an application designed to increase the security and privacy of people using online social networks such as Facebook.  DiscoverFriends is a Wi-Fi-based app that bypasses the servers of an online social network to enable users to communicate with their friends.  Special features such as location-based services enable online social networks to track an individual's activities.  The app uses a Bloom filter-based approach with hybrid encryption and stronger security.  DiscoverFriends can set up communication between friends in the same local Wi-Fi, and make it possible for online social network users to send multi-hop text messages and other data without having to go through the social network's server.  The app also gives users a mechanism to check-in their location anonymously on an online social network by using a new cryptographic primitive, Function Secret Sharing, which puts up a strong defense against traffic-analysis attacks by blocking user ID information.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2e32ex056330&\n\n\nWhat Readers Think About Computer-Generated Texts\nLudwig Maximilians University of Munich (05\/03\/16)\n\nA study conducted by researchers at Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich (LMU Munich) found readers like to read texts generated by computers, in particular when they are unaware what they are reading was created using an algorithm.  In the study, 986 subjects were asked to read and evaluate online news stories, and articles which the participants thought to have been written by journalists were consistently given higher marks for readability, credibility, and journalistic expertise than those deemed computer-generated.  LMU Munich's Andreas Graefe and Hans-Bernd Brosius and colleagues selected two texts from the online editions of popular German news outlets.  One was a report of a soccer match, the other was devoted to the market performance of shares issued by an automotive supplier.  They also used an algorithm developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics to generate texts on the same subjects.  \"The automatically generated texts are full of facts and figures--and the figures are listed to two decimal places,\" says LMU Munich's Mario Haim.  \"We believe that this impression of precision strongly contributes to the perception that they are more trustworthy.\"  However, with respect to readability, readers always rated articles attributed to real journalists more favorably, even when the attribution was deliberately false.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2e32fx056330&\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nUnsubscribe from ACM TechNews at http:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2b0ebx056330&\n\nChange your Email Address for TechNews (log into myACM) at http:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-f07ex2b058x056330&\n\n","is_to":"yes","is_cc":"no","is_bcc":"no","is_reply":"no","got_reply":"no"}

{"body_length":5579,"time":"2014-04-11 12:56:41","reply_desired":"no","is_mailing_list":"yes","subject":"Heartbleed Code Review","is_forward":"no","cc_num":0,"body":"Your classmate posted a new Note. \n\nHeartbleed Code Review\n\nThe heartbleed vulnerability is similar to the cross site scripting (XSS) and injection attacks on the quiz in that it results from a failure to check user input.A secure SSL\/TLS session is relatively costly to set up initially so there is a feature called a 'heart beat' which essentially sends a periodic keep alive message to the server. Internet browsing traffic often consists of a page load followed by a pause period where the user reads the content that was just fetched. Rather than require repeated renegotiation of the SSL session the client can send a heartbeat packet which contains up to a 64KB payload to the server and the server echos the same data back to the client.The OpenSSL C data structure representing this packet is shown below.struct {\u00a0 HeartbeatMessageType type;\u00a0 uint16 payload_length;\u00a0 opaque payload[HeartbeatMessage.payload_length];\u00a0 opaque padding[padding_length];} HeartbeatMessage;The structure consists of a 1 byte message type, a two byte integer specifying how large the payload is, followed by the payload itself and padding. The following code taken directly from the OpenSSL source shows that the payload data is copied without verifying that the user supplied payload length matches the actual size of the provided payload.2412 \/* Read type and payload length first *\/2413 hbtype = *p++;2414 n2s(p, payload);2415 pl = p;24162417 if (s->msg_callback)2418\u00a0\u00a0 s->msg_callback(0, s->version, TLS1_RT_HEARTBEAT,2419\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &s->s3->rrec.data[0], s->s3->rrec.length,2420\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 s, s->msg_callback_arg);24212422 if (hbtype == TLS1_HB_REQUEST)2423 {2424\u00a0\u00a0 unsigned char *buffer, *bp;2425\u00a0\u00a0 int r;2426\u00a0 \u00a02427\u00a0\u00a0 \/* Allocate memory for the response, size is 1 bytes2428\u00a0\u00a0 * message type, plus 2 bytes payload length, plus2429\u00a0\u00a0 * payload, plus padding2430\u00a0\u00a0 *\/2431\u00a0\u00a0 buffer = OPENSSL_malloc(1 + 2 + payload + padding);2432\u00a0\u00a0 bp = buffer;2433\u00a0 \u00a02434\u00a0\u00a0 \/* Enter response type, length and copy payload *\/2435\u00a0\u00a0 *bp++ = TLS1_HB_RESPONSE;2436\u00a0\u00a0 s2n(payload, bp);2437\u00a0\u00a0 memcpy(bp, pl, payload);2438\u00a0 \u00a02439\u00a0\u00a0 r = ssl3_write_bytes(s, TLS1_RT_HEARTBEAT, buffer, 3 + payload + padding);On line 2431 a block of memory is allocated corresponding to the user supplied size of the payload (up to 64KB). Malloc allocates a block of memory but does not clear the previous contents of memory. Therefore on line 2437 when payload number of bytes are copied from the memory address bp are copied to pl it is possible to read information that was previously resident in memory.This error was further exacerbated by the fact that OpenSSL uses it's own malloc function. This is not entirely uncommon and is most likely both a security and performance measure which allows all of the memory used by OpenSSL to be contained within a set address space. The result of this however is that reading beyond the bounds of allocated memory does not result in error from the operating system but instead yields data that has been exclusively used for OpenSSL operations. This could be usernames, passwords, private keys, or other sensitive information.The exploit then consists of an attacker creating packet with a heartbeat type identifier, specifying the payload size as 65535, and the providing a minimum sized actual payload. The server will then respond with a 64KB packet containing the small original payload followed by 64KB of sensitive user and server information. This process can be done repeatedly collecting new sections of memory on each iteration.\n\nhttp:\/\/git.openssl.org\/gitweb\/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=96db902 The OpenSSL repository which is an open source git repository shows the patch that was applied in order to resolve the error. The patch essentially consists of bounds checking to ensure that the user provided payload length matches the actual payload length. If they don't match then the packet is silently discarded.\n\n+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \/* Read type and payload length first *\/+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if (1 + 2 + 16 > s->s3->rrec.length)+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 return 0; \/* silently discard *\/+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 hbtype = *p++;+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 n2s(p, payload);+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if (1 + 2 + payload + 16 > s->s3->rrec.length)+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 return 0; \/* silently discard per RFC 6520 sec. 4 *\/+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pl = p;\n\nBecause heartbeat packets are common and previously expected to be largely inconsequential, there are not a significant number of logs showing whether this vulnerability has been exploited previously.\u00a0 https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2014\/04\/wild-heart-were-intelligence-agencies-using-heartbleed-november-2013 The EFF article details packet captures showing the Heartbleed exploit that had been saved to magnetic tape in November 2014. This provides evidence that the heartbleed exploit was in use but due to the scarcity of logs it is still unclear to what extent the bug will continue to have effect in the future.\n\n\nGo to http:\/\/piazza.com\/class?cid=htvhb45czdp3qs&nid=hnvmet5x5vtjk&token=1gx7ZsJjL2U to view.

The industry is tapping them to engineer the personalities of AI tools to make them capable of seamless interaction with people.  AI writers are tasked with imbuing the AIs with natural-seeming conversational capabilities.  Writers for virtual assistants must typically concoct a backstory for these assistants, and inject personality quirks into even the most mundane operations.  For example, Microsoft Cortana's writing team regularly brainstorms how Cortana should respond to emerging issues, such as political questions.  A major challenge for AI writers and designers is defining the virtual assistant\/human relationship via the bot's personality and approach, especially with personalization such a highly valued quality.  Sense.ly's Cathy Pearl says users can be more accepting of a virtual assistant's mistakes and limitations if it does not project human aspirations and has a sense of humor about it.  Conversational AIs are expected to become essential to the workforce, more than 33 percent of which is forecast to work alongside such technologies by 2019, according to Forrester Data.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e13dx056728&\n\n\nThese Are the Cities Where Tech Workers Live Largest\nUSA Today (04\/07\/16) John Shinal\n\nAnnual data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics demonstrates the value of an education in the science, technology, engineering, or math fields.  Workers employed in computer and math occupations in the cities with the most technology employees earned yearly salaries about 50 percent to 75 percent higher than the overall workforce.  Seattle tech workers, for example, had a mean salary of $108,350, or 78 percent more than the $61,000 earned by all workers there.  That was the highest tech-worker premium in the 10 largest hubs, followed by Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Austin.  The same is true in the burgeoning tech hub of Oakland, CA, where workers in computer and math occupations were paid 70 percent more.  Computer and math occupations in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Jose, and San Francisco all earn more than 60 percent more than their non-tech counterparts.  Although Washington, D.C., is among the largest tech-employing regions, its tech workers had the smallest salary differential, at 54 percent, likely due to the large numbers of federal government workers.  Among tech occupations, software developers and systems analysts were the highest in number in nearly all of the largest tech hubs, surpassing computer programmers, network and database administrators, computer research scientists, and computer-support specialists.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e13ex056728&\n\n\nMapping the Brain to Build Better Machines\nQuanta Magazine (04\/06\/16) Emily Singer\n\nThree teams of neuroscientists and computer scientists have been set up under a five-year U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) program called Machine Intelligence from Cortical Networks (Microns) to determine how the brain performs visual identification and how to mimic this process in machines.  \"We want to revolutionize machine learning by reverse-engineering the algorithms and computations of the brain,\" says IARPA's Jacob Vogelstein.  Each team is simulating a piece of the cerebral cortex that processes vision while also developing algorithms based on the knowledge they gain.  By this summer, each algorithm will be provided with an example of a foreign item and then must pick out instances of it from among thousands of images in an unlabeled database.  Each team is investigating a different analysis-by-synthesis method based on the theoretical concept of the brain's mechanism for vision.  All three teams will track neuronal activity in a cube of brain, and plot out a neuron map with different techniques; from that they will try to extract basic rules governing the circuit, feed those rules into a model, and quantify the model's similarity to an actual brain.  The goal of the Microns project is a map of a cubic millimeter of cortex that will yield new insights about the brain.  A key challenge will be developing machine-learning tools to analyze the vast quantity of data generated by the cortex sample.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e13fx056728&\n\n\n'New Rembrandt' Unveiled in Amsterdam\nThe Guardian (04\/05\/16) Mark Brown\n\nA portrait titled \"the Next Rembrandt\" unveiled on Tuesday is not the work of the renowned Dutch painter, but the end-product of an 18-month project that brought together data scientists, developers, engineers, and art historians.  The project team, which included researchers from Microsoft, the Delft University of Technology, the Mauritshuis in The Hague, and the Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam, was tasked with creating a three-dimensional printed painting in the style of Rembrandt but generated by software.  The new painting represents a distillation of 168,263 fragments from Rembrandt paintings into more than 148 million pixels.  The development team first designed a software system capable of understanding the famed artist according to his use of geometry, composition, and painting materials.  Their next step was to utilize a facial-recognition algorithm to identify and classify the most typical geometric patterns used to paint human features.  Project originator Bas Korsten emphasizes the initiative is not an attempt to create a new Rembrandt.  \"We are creating something new from his work,\" he says.  \"Only Rembrandt could create a Rembrandt.\" Korsten hopes the project leads to a conversation about art and algorithms.  \"While no one will claim that Rembrandt can be reduced to an algorithm, this technique offers an opportunity to test your own ideas about his paintings in concrete, visual form,\" says art historian Gary Schwartz.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e140x056728&\n\n\nHow Data Mining Reveals the Hidden Evolution of American Automobiles\nTechnology Review (04\/06\/16)\n\nErik Gjesfjeld at the University of California, Los Angeles, and colleagues have analyzed the evolution of U.S. automobiles from their invention in the 19th century to the present, and their results provide unprecedented insight into the forces at work in automobile evolution.  Scientists and anthropologists have yet to come to grips with the role of evolution in technological development because nobody agrees on how to measure change in systems in which there is no obvious analogy to familiar ideas of genetics and sexual reproduction.  The team's approach was to treat the birth and death of car models as a kind of fossil record.  Using eBay Motors' extensive database of the make, model, and production years of U.S. cars and trucks from 1896 to 2014, the team plotted the data and analyzed it using a process called a birth-death Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.  The algorithm simulates the process of evolution among individuals to generate a curve showing the rate of origin and extinction of species.  The team ran the model through 10 million generations of individuals to produce a curve that matches the history of automobile production, and they say the approach can be applied to other technologies.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e141x056728&\n\n\nStabilizing Quantum Bits\nMIT News (04\/06\/16) Larry Hardesty\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers have developed a new strategy for preserving superposition in quantum devices built from synthetic diamonds.  MIT professor Paola Cappellaro and former postdoctoral student Masashi Hirose describe a feedback-control system for maintaining quantum superposition without requiring measurement.  A nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in a diamond can represent a quantum bit (qubit) while dispensing with ion- or atom-trapping hardware required by other approaches, and is a natural light emitter as well.  The NV center's electronic spin is controlled using the spin state of the nitrogen nucleus, via a combination of microwave and radio-frequency radiation bursts.  Entanglement of the nitrogen nucleus and the NV center enabled by a second microwave dose ensures any computational errors will be reflected in the nucleus' spin, and once the computation is conducted, a third microwave dose disentangles the nucleus and the NV center.  A final series of calibrated microwave exposures corrects any error that creeps in during computation.  The researchers demonstrated that an NV-center qubit using the feedback-control system would remain in superposition about 1,000 times as long as it would without it.  \"Applications of this technique will appear soon, as demonstrations of new protocols applied to quantum metrology and quantum computing,\" predicts Ulm University professor Fedor Jelezko.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e142x056728&\n\n\nHow Livermore Scientists Will Put IBM's Brain-Inspired Chips to the Test\nIEEE Spectrum (04\/05\/16) Rachel Courtland\n\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory researchers will determine how IBM Research's low-power, brain-inspired TrueNorth chips will fare in extensive experiments.  Devised in 2010 and unveiled in 2014, the IBM\/Cornell University-developed chips can each consume as little as 70 milliwatts and bundle together 5.4 billion transistors.  IBM has built a 16-chip array with new processors that can run on as little as 2.5 watts to demonstrate the system can scale up the approach to bigger and bigger systems, says IBM's Dharmendra Modha, recipient of the 2009 ACM Gordon Bell Prize.  Under a $1-million contract with IBM, Livermore will put the TrueNorth array through its in paces in areas such as cybersecurity and large-scale physical simulation.  Modha stresses the neuromorphic chip architecture is designed to complement, and not replace, traditional computers, and TrueNorth's speed and efficiency are only apparent in specific applications, such as pattern recognition.  Brian Van Essen with Livermore's Center for Applied Scientific Computing says incorporating neuromorphic chips in a heterogeneous computing scheme \"is definitely one potential path\" to exascale computing.  He notes a low-power technology such as TrueNorth would be a good candidate for powering a system designed to monitor the progress of a simulation.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e143x056728&\n\n\nComputational Behavioral Science Develops Tools, Methods to Reach Children With Autism\nNational Science Foundation (04\/04\/16) Miles O'Brien\n\nResearchers from across the U.S. are working with the U.S. National Science Foundation to develop a range of new sensors and other tools to gauge emotional responses and behavior of children with developmental disorders.  For example, Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Rosalind Prichard is developing wearable sensors to measure the subtle changes that naturally occur in the body during social interactions.  The research is focused on children with autism and other nonverbal learning disorders that make it difficult to understand and communicate their emotions.  For example, Prichard's team has developed StoryScape, an open and customizable creative learning platform that creates animated storybooks that can interact with the physical world.  Meanwhile, Georgia Institute of Technology researcher Jim Rehg is developing methods to monitor subtle behaviors, such as eye movements, using wearable cameras.  Rehg's research group is testing a range of sensors on children, some of whom are on the autism spectrum, with the goal of designing new tools for autism research and more effective treatment.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e144x056728&\n\n\nLifelogging and Fiction Can Teach Computers to See How We See\nNew Scientist (04\/06\/16) Aviva Rutkin\n\nResearchers are attempting to enhance artificial intelligences (AIs) to perceive the world as people do to gain a better understanding of humanity.  One effort in this vein is the University of Pennsylvania's EgoNet, a project to build a neural network system that tries to predict what objects would interest people.  The project involves volunteers who wore GoPro video cameras and annotated the first-person footage they shot day by day and frame by frame.  The researchers fed this footage into a computer and repeatedly asked EgoNet to describe the activities it depicted, training it to anticipate what the person was likely to touch or study more intimately.  One network seeks objects likely to stand out due to their hue, position in the scene, or other attributes, while another network estimates how each object might relate to that person.  Meanwhile, a Stanford University project called Augur is trying to give AIs a similar ability by training them on 1.8 billion words of fiction derived from the Wattpad online writing community.  When Augur recognizes an object in a scene, it sifts through what it has read in Wattpad to guess what a person might do with it.  Potential applications for systems such as EgoNet and Augur could include behavioral health diagnosis, screening calls for busy people, and other assistive uses.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e145x056728&\n\n\nImproving Robot-Human Collaboration With the Help of IBM\nASU News (04\/06\/16) Monique Clement\n\nArizona State University (ASU) graduate student Tathagata Chakraborti's automated planning research could help address some of the problems that may arise when humans and autonomous systems interact.  Chakraborti has investigated how autonomous agents sharing human workspaces can modify their behavior and respect human intentions, and he has tested planning algorithms for human-robot collaboration on robots in ASU's Yochan Lab.  Chakraborti's research efforts have earned him an IBM Ph.D. Fellowship Award, and he will participate in an internship in May at IBM's Cognitive Algorithms Department, where he will join the Artificial Intelligence and Optimization Group and work on symbiotic human-AI systems.  The next stage of his research at ASU is to work on the human side of the human-AI team by validating theoretical results on biological data to establish psychological or neuroscientific connections to how humans respond to robotic teammates.  \"This is vital in order for AI algorithms to move from the drawing board to actual integration with human workflows,\" Chakraborti says.  \"I believe that my research will contribute significantly to the progress of standalone automated planners toward addressing the requirements of the human component, and provide much-needed guidance for principled and well-informed design of intelligent symbiotic systems of the future.\"\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e146x056728&\n\n\nAutofocusing Contact Lenses? Today's Chip Research Peeks Into Tomorrow's Gadgets\nCNet (04\/05\/16) Stephen Shankland\n\nImec is expanding into new territory with its latest computer chip technology research projects.  The Belgian design organization focuses on improving microprocessors, but it has increasingly partnered with companies outside the traditional computing industry.  Imec is now working to speed the process of detecting cancer with an image sensor by using chips that work in parallel.  Researchers also have developed a \"hyperspectral\" image sensor that captures as many as 150 precisely chosen colors, which could be used to judge the precise freshness of fruit being sent to grocery stores.  Imec also wants to give contact lenses the ability to autofocus by enabling them to detect where the wearer is trying to focus and letting in light through only the appropriate part of the lens.  In addition, the research center plans to add a thin, transparent film on top of solar panels, which would enable them to convert sunlight more efficiently into electrical power.  Imec also is working on solid-state batteries that last longer and hold more energy; phones, laptops, electric cars, and solar power would benefit from the improvement in energy storage.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e147x056728&\n\n\nLaser Technique Promises Super-Fast and Super-Secure Quantum Cryptography\nUniversity of Cambridge (04\/04\/16) Sarah Collins\n\nUniversity of Cambridge researchers have developed measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), a technique to overcome one of the main issues in implementing a quantum cryptography system.  The researchers say the technology is a breakthrough that could lead to a usable \"unbreakable\" method for sending sensitive information hidden inside light particles.  MDI-QKD involves \"seeding\" one laser beam inside another, making it possible to distribute encryption keys at rates between two and six orders of magnitude higher than previous attempts at quantum cryptography systems.  In the new technique, the sender and receiver send their photons to a central node that lets the photons pass through a beam splitter and then measures them.  MDI-QKD has been experimentally demonstrated, but the information transfer rates are too slow for real-world application because of the difficulty in creating indistinguishable particles from different lasers.  The method developed by the researchers overcomes this problem by using pulsed laser seeding, a technique in which one laser beam injects photons into another.  The technique makes the laser pulses more visible to the central node by reducing the amount of \"time jitter\" in the pulses, so much shorter pulses can be used.  The researchers say this technique in a MDI-QKD system would enable rates as high as 1 Mbps, representing an improvement of two to six orders of magnitude over previous efforts.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e148x056728&\n\n\nThe Robot Will See You Now: U of T Experts on the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine\nU of T News (04\/04\/16) Nina Haikara\n\nThe University of Toronto (U of T) hosted a panel discussion Tuesday on the ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine.  Experts in computer science and medicine explored the issues of privacy, accuracy, and accountability during the session.  Integrating AI successfully into the nuanced setting of patient and doctor interaction and communication creates intriguing challenges for researchers.  Natural language expert Graeme Hirst says a medical AI would have to talk to patients in language used in the real world and deal with all issues of complex conversation and health communication.  Hirst has developed methods for detecting cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease, by examining linguistic changes in a person's writing over time.  U of T professor and panelist Michael Brudno oversees a research group that spans both computational biology and an emerging subfield of computational medicine.  \"Computational biology applies to a much broader set of disciplines, from how to raise better cattle, to forests that are more heat-resistant, because of global warming,\" he notes.  \"Computational medicine is about the application to patients, and to human health.\"  Brudno predicts AI will help to greatly streamline doctors' workflows, but will not replace doctors.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2e149x056728&\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nUnsubscribe from ACM TechNews at http:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2b0ebx056728&\n\nChange your Email Address for TechNews (log into myACM) at http:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_6-ee0ex2b058x056728&\n","is_to":"yes","is_cc":"no","is_bcc":"no","is_reply":"no","got_reply":"no"}

{"body_length":4526,"time":"2012-04-10 00:41:08","reply_desired":"no","is_mailing_list":"no","subject":"Management Accounting 1 (Commom): Final Message AF2110","is_forward":"no","cc_num":0,"body":"Dear AF2110 Students It has been a very meaningful semester for the AF2110 teaching team to teach you this subject as we have seen a lot of improvements in your study, your behaviour, and most importantly, your attitude towards others as well as your own self. At the same time, you have made us think about our own teaching approach and how we can motivate you to learn and ask questions. As the exam is approaching, please take note of the following: 1. The continuous assessment results (pass \/ fail) will be released through the COMMON Blackboard shortly. However, please note that all assessment results are subject to SARP approval. 2. The Final examination will cover ALL the topics taught within this semester. There are three sections. Section A is a case with 42 marks. Section B has two questions with a total of 42 marks. Section C has two questions with 8 marks each (making a total of 16 marks). All questions are compulsory. The mark allocation is subject to change. 3. Students need to attend the final examination or they will fail the course. As in our midterm test or any other professional examinations, no make-up exam will be entertained. 4. You are required to answer Section A with one answer book and Sections B &amp; C with a separate answer book. Thus you will be given TWO answer books during the exam. 5. To facilitate our marking, start a fresh page for each question. 6. BE PUNCTUAL!! Time yourself in answering your questions. Bring your calculator and ball-point pens. Spend a few minutes to read the whole paper and decide on your priority and time allocation. The mark allocation provides certain indications on your time management. 7. Working steps are important ways to allow markers to understand your thinking logic, which are in turn important for us to assess the student\u2019s ability in addressing the problem. Help us (and help yourself) by clearly showing your thinking process (for both computation and discussion questions), such that we could be able to follow your thinking through your answers, and give you the marks you deserve. While both computation and discussion questions are included in the exam, you are reminded that computations are used to support your argument and conclusions. Relevant discussion is not to be replaced by pure numerical answers. 8. The weekly assignment problems would be a good way to assess your ability in understanding business issues. Though the final exam questions are different, the intellectual process required in the final exam has already been covered during class discussions and the weekly assignments. The weekly assignments as well as the case studies provide students good exercises in developing your relevant analytical skills as well as speeding up the computation time which are required in the exam. 9. Please feel free to contact your instructor during the revision and exam period. We will check emails and try our best to respond as soon as we could. If you wish to come to see us, please make the appointment through e-mail. 10. Please be assured that the management accounting team would try our best efforts to ensure that students\u2019 assignments and final exam scripts will be graded with extreme care, and in the best interests of our students. We would review, especially for marginal cases, the paper more than once and see if we could help the student \u2013 of course we also need to maintain the level of quality outcomes and make sure that only students who possess sufficient relevant skills and knowledge would obtain a pass in the subject. 11. In case if you are not satisfied with your final grade, you have the option of filing an application for an independent check (or complaint) with a fee paid to the School. This re-grading process will be done by qualified independent party, but please kindly note that the outcome of such independent check could be favourable (upgrade), unfavourable (downgrade) or the same (original grade sustained) to the applicant.

The idea behind TTL is that we want to continue our mission of being more transparent with you, the community. This past event we had Mike Epner, the President of Topcoder, on to share what the vision of the platform is. Afterwards he was answering questions that you all had submitted via that form I sent out a couple weeks ago.

As Google has announced that it is deprecating its downloads ( http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,i1we,k8ol,jwtk,346k ) effective January 15, 2014, our team has setup an import facility ( http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,k7di,1wp8,jwtk,346k ) so that you can continue your development and distribution of code via SourceForge. The documentation for this facility is available for review here:  http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,aiea,j40x,jwtk,346k\n\nThank you to our beta testers who helped us tighten things up for those projects that will migrate from Google Code.\n\n\n\nNovember Project of the Month\n\nThe November Project of the Month is Password Safe. \n\nPassword Safe ( http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,a5fy,kgbg,jwtk,346k ) is a password database utility. Users can keep their passwords securely encrypted on their computers. A single Safe Combination unlocks them all.\n\n\nRead my interview with Rony Shapiro, the Password Safe project admin, on our blog ( http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,fon2,5k33,jwtk,346k )\u200e to learn more about how it came about, who started it (you might be surprised - I sure was), and more.\n\nCongratulations to Rony and the Password Safe project on being selected as this month's POTM, and thank you for providing a really helpful tool for users.\n\n\nMajor Site News \n\nAside from the Google Code import ( http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,k7di,1wp8,jwtk,346k ), our team also implemented a really nice simplified OAuth facility ( http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,2svn,2aen,jwtk,346k ). It's pretty much a private key you just add to an API URL, which is much simpler than using full OAuth.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nSponsored by Intel(R) XDK NEW\n\nCreate HTML5 and Hybrid Apps with Intel(R) XDK NEW\nDevelop, test and display all major platforms with a single code base. \nDownload it for free now!\nLearn More>> http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,7n8r,145q,jwtk,346k\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nConferences and Meetings We Attend\n\nSourceForge, as part of its engagement in EU Research activities, will lead a one-hour webinar ( http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,gg8t,1z5n,jwtk,346k ) to help attendees understand how to use, enhance or create open source software in a way that maximizes benefits to the business.

A novice programmer can use PWCT to learn programming  concepts like Data Structure, Control Structure, Programming Paradigm, etc.  An expert programmer can use PWCT to develop large and\/or complex software. http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,ieus,jm93,jwtk,346k\n\nsonar-pkg:  Sonar native packages. http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,gboz,75zl,jwtk,346k\n\nThere is a bit of shuffle in this list. Again, it's encouraging to see folks are working and getting more visibility for their hard work.\n\n\nA Closing Note from Your Community Manager\n\nI attended the first-ever \"All Things Open\" conference ( http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,a4y6,8zk2,jwtk,346k ) in Raleigh, North Carolina. I believe that just as OSCON has come to mean OSS in Portland, ATO will be the same in Raleigh. Next year's date is already set for October 22 and 23. If you didn't go this year, you won't be a \"charter attendee\", but, you will attend an excellent conference where the OSS crew will be out in force and will welcome everyone with open arms (and source). The highlight of this conference for me was meeting Luke Ehresman, who wrote SquirrelMail ( http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,ell3,9mdw,jwtk,346k ) - one of the earliest projects on SourceForge. He also did a talk at ATO.\n\nI also attended a bit of the DevBeat conference here in San Francisco ( http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,5j1m,ff4s,jwtk,346k ). I saw a few folks speak, most notably Richard Stallman. He focused on how patents make it hard for developers to easily write code and avoid getting sued (potentially). It's a really interesting topic, but I don't have sufficient space to cover thoroughly here. Regardless, those in attendance took away a lot on which to ponder regarding this topic.\n\nWe are thankful for the OSS community. It's truly a gift to work in a community, and more so when folks are all working to just, \"leave this place a little bit better\" for those who follow. Thank you for all you in the OSS community do for us all.\n\nYou'll find us on Facebook, at http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,gkmh,2zf7,jwtk,346k and on Twitter, at http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,7f1s,77q5,jwtk,346k at http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,jnk3,46ui,jwtk,346k and at http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,ji9k,dpha,jwtk,346k (news, releases, and support, respectively), as well as on Google+ at http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,jdty,28f1,jwtk,346k for news items, and our Google+ community is at http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,900j,jp1s,jwtk,346k\n\nIf you know someone who should be getting this mailing, encourage them to sign up (http:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,j3js,me1b,jwtk,346k\n\nAnd, if you need to get in touch directly, send us email at CommunityTeam@sourceforge.net\n\nWe appreciate all you do for the OSS, SourceForge, and your own project communities.\n\nDaniel Hinojosa \nSourceForge Community Manager\n\n\nUse the following link to send this message to a friend.\nhttp:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,6pp5,dw3v,jwtk,346k&MLM_SITEID=2010001400&MLM_MLID=47672&EMAIL_ADDRESS=lx5491@gmail.com&MLM_UNIQUEID=e2ce8237ec&MLM_MID=2868553\n\n\n=====================================================================================================================\n\nYou are subscribed to the SF.net Update as lx5491@gmail.com\n\nTo unsubscribe, send an email to: unsubscribe-47672@elabs10.com\n\nTo ensure delivery of this newsletter to your inbox, please add sourceforge@newsletters.sourceforge.net to your e-mail address book or safe senders list.\n\nSourceForge | 594 Howard Street,  Suite 300  |  San Francisco, CA  94105\nPrivacy Policy: \nhttp:\/\/newsletter.sourceforge.net\/ct.html?ufl=e&rtr=on&s=x8pb08,1phe1,10s8,8pii,7uiv,jwtk,346k\n\n","is_to":"yes","is_cc":"no","is_bcc":"no","is_reply":"no","got_reply":"no"}

We had successfully\ndeployed before, and after I clicked various links and noted that they were\nworking, we were satisfied.\n\nHowever, a couple of hours later, I went to check the site and it was no\nlonger active.   Upon further investigation, I realized that we had\nincluded two ports in our  app.run function within our app.py file.\nAnother app.run function, one with host 0.0.0.0 and only one port, was\ncommented out.  We had the deployment working before, with the correct\napp.run function, so I'm guessing that we accidentally commented out the\nright function and left the wrong one active, but did not notice since the\nsite had worked at first.\n\nI was wondering if there was any way we could rectify this issue, since we\nare concerned that days of hard work will be lost due to one careless\nerror.

The former project is organized by\nthe Hong Kong Polytechnic University's Department of Computing and Hong\nKong Police Force Regional Crime Prevention Office (Kowloon East Region)\nwith the support of Beat Drug Fund while the latter one is funded by the\nHealth Care and Promotion Fund and is organized by The Hong Kong\nPolytechnic University's Department of Computing, School of Accounting\nand Finance as well as S.K.H. Holy Carpenter Church Community Centre.\nThe summer camps allowed secondary students to learn the adverse\nconsequences from smoking and drug-taking through multimedia production,\nwith the theme of anti-smoking and anti-drugs respectively. Through\nthese, they would know how to reject the temptation from these\nsubstances in reality and choose to live in a healthy way. Hence, they\nare encouraged to pass the messages to their friends and fellow\nschoolmates using their products. The events attract more than 200\nstudents to join and 80 products, including videos, flash games and 3D\nposters, have been received. After several reviews and grading, the\nresults have been finalized. The prize presentation ceremony will be\nheld at Lung Cheung Plaza in Wong Tai Sin on 20 February, at 2:15pm.\n\n\n\nIn order to promote the anti-smoking and anti-drug to the public,\nstudent multimedia products will be shown in the exhibition area at Lung\nCheung Plaza from 1pm to 5pm. Furthermore, Hong Kong Police Force\nRegional Crime Prevention Office (Kowloon East Region), Hong Kong\nLutheran Social Service LC-HKS Limited Evergreen Lutheran Centre and\nS.K.H. Holy Carpenter Church Community Centre will hold their respective\nbooths in order to provide more information about anti-drugs and\nanti-smoking.\n\n\n\nYou are welcome to visit our ceremony and exhibition at Lung Cheung\nPlaza on 20 February to support and encourage the participatory\nstudents! \n\n\n\nIf you are interested in our projects, please visit our websites and\ncontact us by email or by phone as shown below.\n\n\n\nSunshine Pioneer No Drug Web-based Interactive Platform \n\nWebsite: http:\/\/sunshine.comp.polyu.edu.hk\n\nEmail: sunshine@comp.polyu.edu.hk\n\nPhone:  2766-7253\n\n\n\nStopping Tobacco Educational Program\n\nWebsite: http:\/\/ustep.comp.polyu.edu.hk\n\nEmail: ustep@comp.polyu.edu.hk\n\nPhone:  2766-7327\n\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nWHERE INNOVATION MEETS APPLICATION\n\n","is_to":"no","is_cc":"no","is_bcc":"yes","is_reply":"no","got_reply":"no"}

The origin of this result is actually interesting, and Leon Bottou has [a really nice presentation online](http:\/\/leon.bottou.org\/_media\/papers\/vapnik-symposium-2011.pdf) that traces the history.\n\nThere are a few different proofs of this result. The textbook we are using does the inductive proof, but I presented the proof using \"table shifting\". You can find several proofs, including the tabular version,\u00a0[in this nice writeup](http:\/\/www.cse.buffalo.edu\/~hungngo\/classes\/2010\/711\/lectures\/sauer.pdf). Also, the original place I\u00a0found this proof was in [the scribe notes](http:\/\/www.cs.berkeley.edu\/~bartlett\/courses\/281b-sp08\/16.pdf) from a course taught by my PhD advisor years ago -- however, I think these notes skip over the hardest step of the proof.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nJake\n\nJoin the conversation here:\nhttps:\/\/umich.instructure.com\/courses\/8912\/discussion_topics\/22021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ________________________________________\n\n          You received this email because you are participating in one or more classes using Canvas.

There will be invited speakers who will discuss their own digital scholarship projects and collaborations, opportunities for works-in-progress demonstrations, and informal events such as brown bags and coffee hours, to encourage the ongoing, communal transmission of knowledge.\n\nFor more information and a list of upcoming workshops please visit http:\/\/www.lib.umich.edu\/digital-scholarship-workshop-series.\n\n\n\n** Copyright Workshops\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe U-M Copyright Office will be presenting three workshops this semester through the Faculty Exploratory in Hatcher Graduate library.

We strongly suggest students to boycott businesses that deliberately cut employees' salaries.

The signup deadline has been extended to noon on Tuesday, May 3, 2011.\n\nAs this is the first time that a subject of this nature is being offered, there are a lot of questions. We would like to take this chance to answer some of them:\n\nQ: Who can take this subject?\nA: This subject is offered to all full time UGC-funded students.\n\nQ: This is a credit-bearing subject. How does it affect my graduation?\nA: There are three possible modes under which you can take this subject:\n1. If your program allows for free electives (e.g., subjects that you can take in any department), you can take this subject as one of them.\n2. We are going to try and get this subject approved as a GE subject. That will mean that you can use this as one of your GE requirements.\n3. Even if your program does not allow for free electives, you can still take this subject, it just won't count towards your graduating credits.\n\nQ: How will this subject be graded? Will it be very harsh?\nA: We do not anticipate this subject to be any more difficult or easier than a normal GE subject. This means that you will need to work to get an excellent grade (e.g., A or A+), but we do not consider that it will be very difficult to get a good grade.\n\nQ: Do I need to pay extra for this subject?\nA: For full-time UGC-funded students (even those on placement), provided that you have paid your tuition for last semester, you should not need to pay extra to register for the subject. You will need to cover some of the costs if you choose to go on the overseas projects (Cambodia or China), but we are seeking sponsorship which will cover most of the costs.\n\nQ: If I sign up, does this mean I am registered?\nA: No. Signing up for the subject just means that you indicate your interest. There will be an interview and we will register selected students for them.\n\nQ: Do you have a quota for this subject?\nA: We would realistically like to admit around 50-60 students for this subject. However, we do not have a hard quota. If we feel that a student can benefit from this subject, and he\/she can contribute to the service project teams, we will accept him\/her.\n\nQ: When is the deadline?\nA: The new deadline is noon on Tuesday, May 3, 2011. Please send email to saocslp@polyu.edu.hkwith the information required in the poster.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to email Drs Grace Ngai (csgngai@polyu.edu.hk),Stephen Chan (csschan@polyu.edu.hk)or Vincent Ng (cstyng@polyu.edu.hk).Remember to put \"COMP 397\" in the subject title.\n\n\nWith regards\n \nDepartment of Computing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nWHERE INNOVATION MEETS APPLICATION\n\n","is_to":"no","is_cc":"no","is_bcc":"yes","is_reply":"no","got_reply":"no"}

However, there is reason to believe it\u2019s possible to determine FGA from features present in the prostate tissue biopsy images. If so, the costly, time-intensive genetic test may be avoidable. The objective of this marathon match challenge is given an image of a biopsy of cancerous prostate tissue, predict the FGA.\n\n[ learn more <https:\/\/www.topcoder.com\/blog\/prostate-cancer-foundation-stupski-prize-challenge-computational-oncology\/> ]\n\n[ learn more <https:\/\/community.topcoder.com\/tc?module=MatchDetails&rd=16495> ]\n\nData Science Fun Marathon Match #90\n\nThe December Fun Marathon Match (MM #90) is launching on December 14, 2015 at 1pm UTC-4. \n\nAll are welcome, doesn\u2019t matter how inexperienced you are!

The term \u201cattack\u201d may be a misnomer because it is employed by both white and black hats. Comcast and other large organizations have been known to employ the attack. The attack effectively terminates a TCP connection by forging a TCP packet with the RST flag set. The RST flag is interpreted by TCP implementations to reset a connection. When one side of a TCP connection receives a RST flag, the connection is ended.\nImplementing a TCP reset tool can be complicated. TCP\u2019s sequence number system is the main reason why. In order to spoof a TCP RST packet, the code must know the correct sequence number expected by the receiving end of the TCP RST attack. At first glance this seems very difficult because there are 2**32 possible sequence numbers. However, TCP\u2019s window size system and the fact that TCP allows skipping of sequence numbers makes this easier. One must just find a TCP sequence number that falls within the range of the actual sequence number and the window size. This makes the TCP reset feasible.\nPreventing a TCP reset attack lies mostly in the ability to block fake spoofed packets. When an attacker is attempting to guess the sequence number, he or she will send out a large amount of fake packets. If a firewall can detect large amounts of spoofed packets, it can block the IP(s) the packets are sent from; thereby, mitigating the attack.\n There are many tools that implement the TCP reset attack. One of them is Tcpkill. It does not do \u201cblind\u201d TCP reset attacks (the type of attack described in the second paragraph) but requires the ability to sniff packets on the network. However, it still employs the TCP reset attack. I could not find a working version of a \u201cblind\u201d TCP reset attack. It would be interesting to make one.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some resources:\nhttp:\/\/www.blackhatlibrary.net\/TCP-RST_Injection\nhttp:\/\/www.cyberciti.biz\/howto\/question\/linux\/kill-tcp-connection-using-linux-netstat.php\nhttps:\/\/www.eff.org\/wp\/packet-forgery-isps-report-comcast-affair\n\nGo to https:\/\/piazza.com\/class?cid=hum2bvmzahq7a7&nid=hnvmet5x5vtjk&token=1gx7ZsJjL2U to view.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWant Piazza in all your classes?

I am not sure if I have the secret string still and want to confirm if I am on the right path. The Strings window says\u00a0that \"I think you are missing something\". It then has a few strings, one of which possibly is the secret string (not sure but it asks a question and then possibly tells the answer\/secret).\n\nHere are some questions I have regarding this:\n\n1) I am not sure if answer to the question is our secret string or not. Is this what you are looking for (It says I am missing something which gives me a hint that I might be wrong)?\n\n2)\u00a0I am unable to execute the program in command line prompt with random arguments (I don't know what to pass: integers?, strings?, chars?, how many args, No information is given to us). I have tried this on Windows like this:\ncrackme.exe \/\"arg1\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\/\/for strings\ncrackme.exe \/1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \/\/for integers\n\nI have been unsuccessful and it throws the following ERROR: \"The system cannot execute the specified program\". What am I doing wrong (I do not use Windows command prompt, so forgive me if this question is too obvious. I am a MAC user running windows VM)?\n\nThank you so much!\n\nGo to https:\/\/piazza.com\/class?cid=htg82uq4fprtz&nid=hnvmet5x5vtjk&token=1gx7ZsJjL2U to view.

This is a major initiative to help industries meet with the Energy-using Products (EuP) Directive of the European Commission which calls for reducing the energy consumption and other negative environmental impacts that occur during the product's life cycle.\nThis advanced model focuses on selecting materials with high recyclability, eliminating or avoiding hazardous material, choosing green production processes, maximising energy and water efficiencies, and minimising waste. By optimising processes and resources, manufacturers will improve their cost effectiveness through minimising the consumption of materials and energy; and by removing wastes and contaminants in production.\nThis project has brought together inter-disciplinary researchers of PolyU. Led by Dr Winco Yung, the key members include Professor Lorraine Justice and Professor Yanta Lam from the School of Design, and Professor Yue Tai-man and Ir Albert C.K. Choi of ISE.\n\n\nProfessor Eric Cheng (left), Department of Electrical Engineering and Mr Jacky Lau (right), Vice President of Green Power Industrial Ltd.\nSpecial Prize and Silver Medal: Solar Powered Air Conditioning System for Vehicles \nInventor: Professor Eric Cheng, Department of Electrical Engineering\nWorking in collaboration with industry partners, researchers of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University have successfully developed a Solar-powered Air-conditioning System for vehicles and completed a series of testing on the road. The innovative system is developed by Professor Eric Cheng together with Green Power Industrial Ltd. With the support of Swire Coca-Cola Hong Kong, the system has been installed on the top of a truck for carrying beverages and proved to work on the road.\nThe system derives power from solar photovoltaic cell for storage in a battery to support power to all electronics onboard and electric air-conditioning unit. Maximum power point technique is developed to track maximum power from the solar panel and a special solar charging technique is used. The electric air-conditioning is driven by energy saving variable speed drive to provide excellent performance. Dual power mode of control is used for power conditioning in a safe manner. The system is readily applied to any vehicles to provide air-conditioning with the engine off during idling.\nUnder the patronage of the Swiss Federal Government, of the State, the City of Geneva and of the World Intellectual Property Organisation, the 39th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva was held from 6 to 10 April 2011.

In this talk we consider three lenses\nfor improving software quality and reducing the cost of software\nmaintenance. We delve into not only approachable human studies (from\nsoftware readability judgments to medical imaging of developers) but also\nrigorous and formal proof and invariant techniques (built atop static and\ndynamic information). We focus, however, on recent results in automated\nprogram repair, in which candidate fixes for software bugs are constructed\nusing focused analyses and program transformations. In each case we\nsummarize lessons learned and highlight reproducible research and key\ninsights. Programming languages are the interface between human developers\nand software systems: program understanding and transformation are powerful\nlevers that can move the world of software quality.\n\n","is_to":"no","is_cc":"no","is_bcc":"yes","is_reply":"no","got_reply":"no"}

Need a few nice photos of each trips for each course (name the folders based on trip destination and date, e.g. 20140123_Guizhou_xxxx primary school, and make a Word in each folder to briefly describe the trip in both Chinese and English, and then name the photos inside the folder by date and activity name, e.g. 20140123_happy_camp_1).

Any tips or hints are appreciated.\n\nAlso if an instructor could tell us what the output is for one of the failed test cases that would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\nGo to https:\/\/piazza.com\/class?cid=ilwvdv78s2p766&nid=iicdr02eshf424&token=h7VVaucxNFE to view.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFailing all index_server tests but 1-2  (3\/17\/16 12:53 PM)\n\nWe're failing all Index_server tests except food and stopwords. Since we're passing at least 2 tests I assume its not a compiler error like in @1446. However, when I run make I do get the same error:\n\nIndex_server.cpp:78:12: warning: 'std::string {anonymous}::get_param(const mg_request_info*, const char*)' declared 'static' but never defined [-Wunused-function]\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 string get_param(const mg_request_info *, const char *);\n\nWe have the updated Index_server.cpp as well as all our functions defined as static.\n\nThe similarity scores seem to match what we compute manually, so we're unsure where to go from here.\n\nThanks\n\nGo to https:\/\/piazza.com\/class?cid=ilwinhmklrw3mm&nid=iicdr02eshf424&token=h7VVaucxNFE to view.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFailing All Index_server cases  (3\/17\/16 8:13 PM)\n\nHi, we are failing all the index_server cases, but have manually tested on our website and seem to be getting the right results.

Any deviation from the given details (e.g. dates, event nature, place, scale, type and number of service recipients, etc.) must have the prior approval of the Student Affairs Office (SAO). If not, the award will be withdrawn. Without the prior written approval from SAO, no activities under this Scholarship will be allowed to receive other monetary sponsorship or donations. Only PolyU full-time government-funded students are eligible for the scholarship. The amount of scholarship was calculated based on a group of 28 full-time government-funded students. Your team is required to send SAO a list of participants (names, student IDs and departments) on or before 16 April 2012. The amount of scholarship shall be adjusted downwards if the number of eligible student participants is different from the above mentioned number. The payment of the scholarship will be in a form of reimbursement and, under no circumstances, the final amount will exceed HK$ 69,984. Your team shall submit an activity report, a financial report, and an evaluation report together with valid expenditure receipts to SAO within one month upon the completion of the project, to qualify for the reimbursement. Your team shall properly acknowledge the Dr. Y. K. Ching Memorial Fund in all publicity material(s) and publication(s) of the project. Your team must complete the project by 31 August 2012.

If you have not already taken advantage of this offer and enrolled in the Payment Plan, you may wish to take a moment and review the following benefits that enrollment can offer:\n\n-Easy to manage your account: Spread your payments for Fall Term over 5 monthly payments.  Fall Term payments are due 06\/30\/2016 through 10\/31\/2016.  \n-No Interest Payments: The U-M Payment Plan is interest free. It can be used on its own or in addition to scholarships, loans and other forms of financial aid.\n-Convenient online enrollment:  Students and authorized Parents & Family may enroll in the U-M Payment Plan through Wolverine Access (http:\/\/wolverineaccess.umich.edu):\n1)\tSelect Student Business (Parents & Family select \u201cMy Student\u2019s Information\u201d)\n2)\tSelect Account Inquiry under the Finances Section\n3)\tSelect the Payment Plan tab at the top of the Page\n4)\tSelect the Enroll tab\n5)\tComplete the four step enrollment process\n\nIf enrolled in the Payment Plan, U-M will post a single credit to your student account for the Fall Term in the amount you specify.  There is a non-refundable enrollment fee of $30 each term to enroll in the Plan.  \n\nWhen enrolling in the Plan, you will need to specify a Plan amount.  Fall Term 2016 charges will not post to your student account until August.  We suggest that you use current year rates for tuition\/fees and the estimated 2016-2017 room\/board rates to estimate your Plan amount.  (Please note that the Regents are scheduled to approve 2016-2017 room, board, tuition, and fee rates in late June.)  The current year tuition\/fee rates are available on the U-M Registrar\u2019s website and the estimated 2016-2017 room\/board rates are available on the U-M Housing website listed below:\n\nU-M Housing (room\/board rates):  http:\/\/www.housing.umich.edu\/billing\/undergrad\n\nU-M Registrar (tuition and fee rates):  http:\/\/www.ro.umich.edu\/tuition\/tuition-fees.php\/\n\nThe Payment Plan will not automatically adjust to cover actual charges for the term.  Once the actual charges are calculated and posted to your student account in August, the Plan amount may be adjusted as appropriate to cover actual expenses.  Increases and decreases will be accepted for the Fall Term Plan through September 30, 2016.\n\nPlease note:  Enrollment in the U-M Payment Plan is optional.  If you\u2019d rather not use the interest-free payment plan, you can also pay each term\u2019s expenses as they are due. The fall term payment for tuition, fees, plus room and board is due August 31, 2016, while the winter term payment is due January 4, 2017.\n\nIf you would like additional information on the U-M Payment Plan, please contact our office at 877.840.4738 or visit our website (http:\/\/www.finops.umich.edu\/student\/payments\/paymentplans).\n\nPlease don\u2019t delay!  Enroll in the Fall Term 2016 U-M Payment Plan today!  \n\nPLEASE NOTE:  If you have already enrolled in the Payment Plan for Fall Term 2016 no further action is required.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDo not reply to this message or save the email address for future use.

One group would be skilled in designing or building systems that rely on the same or similar principles as those used by the brain, while the other would have credible ideas for how neural computing can yield practical benefits for next-generation computers.  \"Despite significant progress in machine learning over the past few years, today's state-of-the-art algorithms are brittle and do not generalize well,\" IARPA notes.  \"In contrast, the brain is able to robustly separate and categorize signals in the presence of significant noise and non-linear transformations, and can extrapolate from single examples to entire classes of stimuli.\"  IARPA outlines issues it wants computer scientists to focus on, such as the current state of research in the utilization of spike-based representations, sparse coding, and\/or approximate computations for digital or analog computing systems.  A related issue IARPA wants answered concerns whether existing hardware systems use representations similar to spikes, while another topic of interest--asynchronous computation--also focuses on existing hardware.  The agency asks the same questions about the current state of research and the existence of hardware and application areas\/use cases for topics such as online learning over short and long time scales, and co-local memory storage and computation.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_5-e839x2dac9x056166&\n\n\nAI Algorithm Identifies Humorous Pictures\nTechnology Review (01\/08\/16)\n\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State University researcher Arjun Chandrasekaran and colleagues report training a machine-learning algorithm to recognize and generate humorous scenes.  They say the algorithm can accurately predict whether a scene is funny, even though it has no knowledge of the picture's social context.  The team asked workers on Amazon's Mechanical Turk service to produce funny scenes out of clip art, along with a short caption explaining the humor of the scene.  They then were asked to create humorless scenes, and in this fashion the researchers compiled a database of 6,400 images that were 50 percent funny and 50 percent unfunny.  Other Mechanical Turk workers were asked to rate how funny each scene was, and the resulting insights spurred the researchers to modify the 3,000 funny images in five ways to create a database of 15,000 unfunny counterparts of funny pictures.  The machine-learning algorithm was trained to differentiate between funny and unfunny scenes by conducting two tasks--predicting the funniness of an image, and altering the funniness of an image by replacing an object in it.  \"The model learns...animate objects like humans and animals are more likely sources of humor compared to inanimate objects and therefore tends to replace these objects,\" the researchers note.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_5-e839x2dacax056166&\n\n\nDrone Swarms Will Change the Face of Modern Warfare\nWired (01\/07\/16) David Hambling\n\nSwarms of inexpensive, expendable U.S. Navy robots this summer will leave the laboratory to be tested in the field.  The Navy's Low-Cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Swarming Technology (LOCUST) program will demonstrate 30 drones flying together somewhere over the ocean.  A swarm \"has a mission that it has to carry out, and it is self-reconfiguring so that if one drone gets taken out, the others autonomously change their behavior to complete the mission,\" says Swarm Systems CEO Stephen Crampton.  He notes the advantage of a swarm is it can be attacked and continue a mission, compared to a singular aircraft, manned or unmanned, that can be brought down by one missile.  The major breakthrough in this research is the ability of the drones to communicate and be aware of each other, says LOCUST project manager Lee Mastroianni.  The U.S. Navy has been working with Georgia Institute of Technology researchers to develop a system in which individual drones will position themselves autonomously, flying in formation without being told explicitly where to go.  The underlying hardware for the LOCUST program is the Coyote drone, a meter-long unmanned aircraft that was designed as an expendable reconnaissance asset with folding wings.  However, Mastroianni says the hardware is less important than the sensors and software enabling the drones to act in a swarm.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_5-e839x2dacbx056166&\n\n\nTaskmaster Robots Watch While You Work in Case You Miss a Step\nNew Scientist (01\/09\/16) Anna Nowogrodzki\n\nResearchers at Stanford and Cornell universities have developed Watch-bot, a robot that can watch people work, learn the steps that make up the task, and remind people when they forget a step.  In 24 trials monitoring humans working in the office and kitchen, Watch-bot was about 60-percent accurate in identifying the missed task.  Watch-bot is comprised of a depth-sensing camera mounted on a tripod, which is connected to a computer and laser pointer.  The researchers say Watch-bot could help people with daily activities, especially elderly people who want to live independently.  The researchers want to conduct more tests before they trust the robotic system with vital safety tasks.  The system's best feature is its simplicity, notes Stanford University researcher Ashutosh Saxena.  The researchers predict Watch-bot could only require about a week of watching humans working in the office or at home to learn enough to give helpful reminders.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_5-e839x2daccx056166&\n\n\nDo You Say Splinter, Spool, Spile, or Spell? English Dialects App Tries to Guess Your Regional Accent\nUniversity of Cambridge (01\/11\/16) Stuart Roberts\n\nUniversity of Cambridge researchers have developed English Dialects, an application that tries to guess the user's regional accent based on the pronunciation of 26 words and colloquialisms.  The researchers aim to use the app to track the movement and changes in English dialects in the modern era.  The app also asks users to create their own recordings in order to determine how dialects have changed over the past 60 years.  The app follows similar programs for German-speaking Europe, which collected more than 1 million hits in four days on Germany's Der Spiegel website, and more than 80,000 downloads of the app by German speakers in Switzerland.  The researchers based the app on the Survey of English Dialects, which dates back 60 to 70 years as the first large-scale documentation of English dialects, focusing on 313 localities across England.  The app asks users how they pronounce certain words or which dialect term they most associate with commonly used expressions, and then produces a heatmap for the likely location of the dialect based on the answers.  \"We hope the app will harness people's fascination with dialect to enable us to paint a more up-to-date picture of how dialect features are spread across the country,\" says University of Cambridge professor David Britain.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_5-e839x2dacdx056166&\n\n\nRobotic Glove Invented by NUS Researchers Helps Patients Restore Hand Movements\nNational University of Singapore (01\/11\/16)\n\nNational University of Singapore (NUS) researchers have developed the EsoGlove, a rehabilitation device equipped with sensors to detect muscle signals.  The researchers say the device consists of soft materials and conforms to the natural movements of the human hand, which reduces discomfort and risk of injury.  \"EsoGlove is designed to enable patients to carry out rehabilitation exercises in various settings,\" says NUS professor Raye Yeow.  EsoGlove is connected to a pump-valve control system, which modulates the air pressure to direct the soft actuators.  It also uses an intuitive control mechanism, which involves the coupling of electromyography and radio-frequency identification technologies, thus enabling the glove to detect a patient's intent to perform a hand action on a specific object.  \"With this unique approach, we can develop therapeutic tools using safe and wearable robotic technology,\" says NUS researcher Lim Jeong Hoon.  The soft actuators in the EsoGlove are made from non-ferromagnetic materials, making them suitable for use in functional magnetic-resonance imaging studies.  \"We hope that the robotic glove can contribute towards investigating the brain's activity in relation to motor performance during hand rehabilitation, and unravel the functional effects of soft rehabilitation robotics on brain stimulation,\" says NUS Ph.D. candidate Yap Hong Kai.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_5-e839x2dacex056166&\n\n\nNew Digital Tools Could Help Speed Up Cultural Heritage Work\nCORDIS News (01\/08\/16)\n\nThe European Union-funded PRESIOUS project is developing software tools intended to facilitate the work of archaeologists via computer simulations.  Once the project is completed, the tools will be made freely available for archaeologists to download.  \"In order to better understand what monuments will look like under certain erosive conditions, for example, we built simulation software--within the timescale and resources available--that enables an archaeologist to scan a stone object and estimate erosion patterns under different conditions,\" says Norwegian University of Science and Technology professor Theoharis Theoharis.  Other objectives for the software include helping archaeologists piece together fragmented findings, such as solving three-dimensional (3D) puzzles, and filling in gaps in archaeological objects with symmetry.  To accelerate the digitization process, the consortium's industry partner helped develop predictive scanning, which uses predictions based on 3D object retrieval from repositories of previously digitized objects.  The technique is useful for applications in which cost reductions are essential and precise scanning is not necessarily the end-goal.  Feedback on the PRESIOUS tools from the archaeological community at various conferences, seminars, and demonstrations has been very positive, according to Theoharis.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_5-e839x2dacfx056166&\n\n\nGrant Targets Quantum Computing's Error Control Challenge\nDuke University News (01\/06\/16)\n\nResearchers led by Duke University and the University of Maryland have won a grant from the U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) to apply ion traps toward addressing quantum bit (qubit) degradation for quantum information applications.  IARPA has chosen the Duke\/Maryland\/Georgia Institute of Technology consortium as a LogiQ awardee to pursue the goal of cohering a large number of atomic qubits to produce modular \"super-qubits\" that can be scaled up while correcting for errors.  Ion trappers have become very proficient at controlling a small number of individual qubits, and the consortium previously proposed and conducted demonstrations indicating its approach is scalable and modular.  In a modular super-qubit, the stored data is encoded into specialized quantum states comprising multiple physical qubits.  Distributing the information in this manner boosts protection while also allowing for errors to be detected and corrected, without knowing the precise details of the quantum state as a whole.  \"We know how to build a quantum computer with 50 to 100 qubits with trapped ions right now,\" notes the University of Maryland's Christopher Monroe.  \"This is a big enough system that we cannot simulate what happens, even with all the conventional computers in the world.  But some killer applications of quantum computing require thousands or millions of qubits, and error correction will be crucial to getting there.\"\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_5-e839x2dad0x056166&\n\n\nCybersecurity Experts Debate Proper Response to Terrorism\nColumbia News (01\/06\/16) Georgette Jasen\n\nThe recent terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, CA, are spurring calls for more government access to people's electronic communications, but privacy advocates and many cybersecurity experts are concerned about that strategy.  \"There are real tradeoffs here among security, law enforcement, privacy, innovation, and cybersecurity,\" says Columbia University professor Matthew Waxman, who co-chairs the Center for Cybersecurity at Columbia's Data Science Institute with Columbia computer science professor Steven Bellovin.  Bellovin says giving the government exceptional access would not reduce the threat of terrorism but rather would create new holes in computer security that others can exploit.  He supports Congress setting conditions for government access to electronic communication, much as a search warrant is required for a wiretap.  Jason Healey, a senior research scholar at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, says terrorists have always used whatever technology was available to get their message across and recruit new followers, and access to encrypted communications only works if you know who to listen to.  Law enforcement must improve its surveillance efforts, and governments need to share information, Healey adds.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_5-e839x2dad1x056166&\n\n\nBetter Coding\nUDaily (DE) (01\/06\/16)\n\nUniversity of Delaware researchers have demonstrated how natural-language processing and sentiment-analysis techniques can be used to mine bad, or negative, code examples from software developer forums.  The researchers say the process can be used to help programmers in their learning and code improvement efforts.  The researchers presented their study at the Fourth International Workshop on Software Mining in Lincoln, NE, and it also was published in the proceedings of the 2015 IEEE\/ACM 30th International Conference on Automated Software Engineering Workshops (ASEW 2015).  \"Having the opportunity to present our research and hear from leaders in the software field was an invaluable experience,\" says University of Delaware researcher Zachary Senzer, who worked with Ryan Serva on the project.  \"It was fascinating to see how our work fits into the large-scale puzzle that researchers around the world are solving and refining.\"  The researchers were mentored by University of Delaware professors Lori Pollock and Vijay Shanker.\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_5-e839x2dad2x056166&\n\n\nAccess to Millions of U.S. Patent Records Will Dramatically Improve Due to Work of UMass Amherst Computer Scientists\nUMass Amherst (01\/06\/16) Janet Lathrop\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst) researchers have been awarded the top prize in an international contest sponsored by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Their winning technique uses an \"entity disambiguation\" algorithm that rapidly eliminates inventor ambiguity from patent records to facilitate more efficient and effective searches.  Their strategy will be incorporated into USPTO's new PatentsView platform, and UMass Amherst professor Andrew McCallum's Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory will receive a stipend for technical guidance on applying the algorithm to the platform's records.  Entity disambiguation entails distinguishing between many individuals with similar characteristics and grouping them together unambiguously, reports UMass Amherst graduate student Nicholas Monath.  Inventor disambiguation is essential to USPTO, as inventors often appear in patent records with different names, spellings, and nicknames or because multiple inventors may have the same name.  Contest participants were tasked with disambiguating the inventors of more than 12 million patent records filed between 1976 and 2014.  \"Our method uses a hierarchical approach to disambiguation, which has several advantages over alternative pairwise approaches,\" Monath says.  \"Our method considers groups of two or more mentions in determining the disambiguation and has a more efficient disambiguation procedure.\"\nhttp:\/\/orange.hosting.lsoft.com\/trk\/click?ref=znwrbbrs9_5-e839x2dad3x056166&\n\n\nNew Technology to Provide Insights Into the Health of Students\nNotre Dame News (01\/06\/16) William G. Gilroy\n\nNew research from the University of Notre Dame provides a broader understanding of how technology is embedded in students' lives as they transition from teenagers to young adults.  Researchers David Hachen and Omar Lizardo tracked the cellphone usage and behavior of 200 entering freshmen volunteers and found they quickly form social networks, generally within 10 to 15 weeks.  The size of social networks varied greatly, with some numbering five or six and others 50 or more, which may be a function of personality.  Women and minorities also had larger social networks, Hachen and Lizardo found.  Some observers believe college-age students are tuning out of group settings as they focus on their cellphones, but the research indicates they are keeping their network informed of interesting things happening in their lives.

We at OHR and OIE understand this, and want to help!\n\nThis year the IRS has delayed all tax filings and will not accept returns earlier than January 31, 2014.  Please keep in mind that all non-US citizens (who are not US green card holders) should first use the GLACIER tax compliance system to determine if you are a resident or nonresident alien for tax purposes.  If GLACIER determines that you are a nonresident for tax purposes, we can help!  As a nonresident for tax purposes you will be able to complete your federal tax return using GLACIER Tax Prep (GTP) which will be available for use via your current GLACIER account no later than February 17, 2014.\n\nWorkshops assisting with the Georgia state tax forms will be held February 24 through April 14 with dates, times, and locations to be announced soon.\n\nAlso, please be reminded that both resident and nonresident aliens for tax purposes who claimed treaties in 2013, as well as all those students who are nonresident aliens for tax purposes receiving scholarships above and beyond tuition, will need a form 1042-S to complete their tax return.  1042-S forms will also be released no later than February 17, 2014.  Recipients will receive an email from GLACIER when the form is ready for use.\n\nSee OIE\u2019s Tax Website (http:\/\/oie.gatech.edu\/content\/tax-services-oie)  and the International Student and Scholar Tax FAQ website for additional information and send any questions to nra.ask@ohr.gatech.edu.

While the general\nprocedure follows the standard framework of supervised learning,\nsignificant challenges arose in (1) determining what types of data to\ncollect, (2) how to clean and align the data in both space and time, and\n(3) how to deal with various deficiencies in the data. I will first\ndescribe the use of host malicious activity data (including spam, phishing,\nand active scanning) combined with network configuration data to obtain\nincident prediction at an organizational level. I will then describe the\nadditional use of business details about an organization to obtain more\nfine-grained prediction, which looks at not just the overall risk of an\nincident, but the types of incidents it is particularly susceptible to. I\nwill end the talk by describing how our ability to make predictions, or\nmore generally, our ability to quantify at a global level the security\npostures of organizations, may be viewed as creating a form of \"public\nmonitoring\", which can be crucial in designing mechanisms that rely on\ninter-temporal incentives to induce socially desirable behaviors, from\nsecurity practice to security investment to information sharing. This is\njoint work with my current students Parinaz Naghizadeh and Armin Sarabi, my\nformer student Yang Liu, as well as Prof. Michael Bailey from UIUC.\n\n*Biography:* Mingyan Liu received her Ph.D in electrical engineering from\nthe University of Maryland, College Park, in 2000. She has since been with\nthe Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where she is currently a Professor. Her\nresearch interests are in optimal resource allocation, incentive design,\nand performance modeling and analysis, all within the context of\ncommunication networks. Her most recent research activities involve online\nlearning, modeling and mining of large scale Internet measurement data\nconcerning cyber security, and incentive mechanisms for inter-dependent\nsecurity games. She is the recipient of the 2002 NSF CAREER Award, the\nUniversity of Michigan Elizabeth C. Crosby Research Award in 2003 and 2014,\nthe 2010 EECS Department Outstanding Achievement Award and the 2015 College\nof Engineering Excellence in Education Award. She holds Best Paper Awards\nfrom the International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor\nNetworks (IPSN) in 2012 and the IEEE\/ACM International Conference on Data\nScience and Advanced Analytics (DSAA) in 2014. She serves\/has served on the\neditorial board of IEEE\/ACM Trans. Networking, IEEE Trans. Mobile\nComputing, and ACM Trans. Sensor Networks.

Protesters were brutally massacred. The army moved into the \nsquare from several directions and randomly fired on unarmed protesters, \nresulting in a large number of casualties. Subsequently, the Chinese \nCommunist government condemned the protests as a \"counterrevolutionary \nriot\", and has prohibited all forms of discussion or remembrance of the \nevents within China, refusing to recognize history.\n\nJune 4 Massacre has passed for twenty-four years but the event has not \nbeen officially rehabilitated yet. Since that time, political agitation \nhas been extremely muted in China. The Chinese government suppresses \ndissentient, incrimination, and human rights abuses are frequent. \nChinese people's aspirations for democracy reform still cannot be met. \nStarting from 1989, Hong Kong people hold vigil for Tiananmen Massacre \nvictims. This year, the Student Union will hold a candlelight vigil in \nthe evening of May 31in PolyU as well as an exhibition about June 4 \nMassacre.\n\nJune 4 Massacre Candlelight Vigil in PolyU\nDate: 31\/05\/2013 (Friday)\nTime: 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm\nLocation: FJ Podium\nGuests: Joseph Tse (media worker, witness of the June 4 Massacre),\n         Yiu Keung Lam (witness of the June 4 Massacre),\n         Ching Wah Chan (witness of the June 4 Massacre)\n\nContents: candlelight vigil, film watching, sharing by witnesses of the \nJune 4 Massacre.\n\nJune 4 Massacre Exhibition\nDate: 31\/05\/2013 to 06\/06\/2013\nLocation: FJ Podium\nContents: Newspaper clippings, photographs, timeline, sharing and \ninformation of other activists\n\nWe appeal to students who pursue democracy, freedom and human rights to \nparticipate the June 4 Massacre Candlelight Vigil.\n\nShould you have any enquiries, please do not hesitate to contact the \nmembers of executive committee.\n\nThe 20th Session of Hong Kong Polytechnic University Students\u2019 Union\nExecutive Committee\n\n\n\n","is_to":"no","is_cc":"no","is_bcc":"yes","is_reply":"no","got_reply":"no"}

Below are some scholarships available for current full-time LOCAL Ug COMP students, unless otherwise specified, to apply:\n\n\n\nName of Scholarship\n\nNo. & Value\n\nCriteria\n\n1)\n\nChiap Hua Cheng's Foundation Scholarship\n\n2 x $24,000\n\nTo 2 UGC-funded degree students. The nominees are required to have the class attendance rate, if any, of at least 80% in the first semester of the 2014\/15 academic year.\n\n\n2)\n\nHKCC Scholarship\n\n\n3 x $6,000\n\n\nTo 3 HKCC graduates, admitted to a FT\/PT degree programme in or before 2013\/14 (i.e. students from 2014\/15 intake cohort are NOT eligible for the Scholarship 2014\/15).\n\nThe award of the scholarships is based on the candidate's academic excellence (GPA in the academic year 2013\/14 preferably >3), extent of involvement of services to PolyU or the community and excellent achievements in co-curricular activities (e.g. achievement in sports and music, serving as official of student organizations, etc.). Both local and non-local students are eligible. Student who had been awarded the HKCC Scholarship before should NOT be nominated again in the same degree programme of studies.\n\n\nPlease use the specially-designed nomination form attached to the email.\n\n\n3)\n\n\nLi Po Chun Charitable Trust Fund Scholarship\n\n2 x $16,720\n\n\nTo 2 UGC-funded non-first-year students.

Both local and non-local students are eligible. Preference to student who is member of IEEE and IEEE PolyU Student Branch.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, may I draw your attention to the following:-\n\n1)      The main criterion for the award of academic scholarship is academic merit.  Unless otherwise specified, the minimum cumulative GPA or the latest Semester GPA (whichever is higher) of the awardee is preferably at least 3.0.  Where students are of comparable academic merit, other criteria such as financial need, leadership potential and personality are to be taken into consideration.\n\n\n\n2)      Unless otherwise stipulated, a student can concurrently hold more than one scholarship administered by the University in an academic year if the total value of scholarships received by him\/her does not exceed his\/her annual tuition fee payable plus HK$40,000. You may refer to the attached leaflet on \"Guideline Governing the Concurrent Holding of Scholarships\" for details.\n\n\n\n3)      All the nominations are subject to the donors' final approval; and the donors reserve the right to withdraw the scholarships in case there is no deserving candidate or any other unforeseen circumstances.   Upon approval of the nominations, SAO will inform the awardees of the selection results direct (normally around two to three months after the nomination deadline) and release payment to the awardees afterwards.\n\n\n4)      The scholarship awardees are required to attend the presentation ceremony\/tea reception hosted by the donors\/PolyU, if any.\n\nEligible students please submit the form, a latest CV and a copy showing your latest academic performances (GPA of last semester) to Ms Winifred Ng on or before 16 Jan 2015 (Thurs). Late application may not be considered.\n\nThanks & regards\nJennifer\n\n\n       ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Disclaimer:\n\nThis message (including any attachments) contains confidential information intended for a specific individual and purpose.
